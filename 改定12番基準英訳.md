Abstract

This paper presents a diagnostic theory that interprets the phenomenon where monetary easing and standard macroeconomic policies in advanced economies fail to generate sustainable growth accompanied by improvements in employment not as “policy failure” or temporary demand deficiency, but as structural depletion of investment outlets. As core concepts, it introduces the structural frontier coefficient Φ, representing potential constraints defined by demographics, institutional environments, and capital structures, and the critical threshold θ where policy effects undergo qualitative transformation. While Solow-type growth theory and New Keynesian transmission mechanisms generally function effectively in the Φ > θ region, in the Φ ≤ θ region, monetary easing fails to induce real investment and instead tends to manifest as asset price increases or capital flight. This paper presents a diagnostic identification procedure using the realized investment ratio a (=α̂) and the asymmetry of employment, growth, and price responses, under the definitional constraint of not back-calculating Φ from outcome variables. Furthermore, under the hypothesis that in mature/constrained regimes, substitution elasticity declines and dominant bottlenecks determine investment realization, we position the min approximation not as a predictive function but as a diagnostic limit.



1. Limitations of Existing Theory

Existing macroeconomic theories have focused on mechanisms such as demand deficiency, nominal rigidities, distorted expectation formation, and financial frictions when explaining or predicting growth rates, inflation rates, or policy effects. The Solow-type growth theory has effectively explained long-term equilibrium on the supply side, while the New Keynesian model has effectively explained short-term demand management and policy transmission.

 However, in recent years, advanced economies have repeatedly observed a phenomenon where monetary easing improves employment but fails to generate sustained growth—a pattern existing frameworks cannot fully explain.



2. Unresolved Issues

This phenomenon is often described as “policy failure,” “temporary demand deficiency,” or “liquidity trap” and “secular stagnation.” Yet, no unified theoretical explanation has been provided for why the same policy proves effective in one context but structurally ineffective in another. Existing research lacks a framework to identify in advance the conditions under which policies become ineffective. Consequently, the loss of policy effectiveness remains a post-hoc description of phenomena.



3. Contribution of this Paper

This paper reframes this gap by focusing on the transition to a phase where the investment targets themselves become structurally depleted. That is, it posits that the core issue lies not in demand or frictions themselves, but in the structural constraints on investment absorption capacity that manifest through them. To capture this structural change, the paper introduces the structural frontier coefficient Φ. Φ is a theoretical variable representing latent constraints generated by multiple deep-seated conditions—such as demographic trends, institutional environment, and industrial/capital structure. Crucially, the focus is not on precisely estimating Φ, but on using it as an ordinal scale to identify where each economy lies within the spectrum of structural constraints. This limitation theoretically precludes circular reasoning where structural conditions are reverse-engineered from outcome variables.



4. Relationship to Existing Theories

From this perspective, neither the Solow-type growth theory nor the New Keynesian model are objects to be negated. Rather, they are repositioned as theories with limited applicability, functioning effectively only in regions where the structural frontier is sufficiently high (Φ > θ). Similarly, the liquidity trap and the theory of secular stagnation are phenomena observed approximately in regions where Φ falls below the critical threshold θ; they are not theories explaining the root cause themselves.

I.1 Dynamic Properties of the Structural Frontier: Endogenous Rigidity

I.1.1 The Fundamental Hypothesis of a Phase Transition in Substitution Elasticity

This paper posits a regime-dependent hypothesis that substitution elasticity may decline depending on the economy's maturity. It does not presuppose a mathematically discontinuous change, but argues that a phase can be observed in which substitution elasticity steeply declines near a critical point and bottleneck dominance intensifies. Therefore, the paper's verification target is not “proving discontinuity,” but rather the existence of a consistent pattern where “policy effects, investment allocation, and auxiliary indicators simultaneously switch in a regime-dependent manner.”

The economy is described as a system oscillating between two distinct phases:

Phase I: Expansion and Substitution Domain (Φ > θ)

In the initial and growth stages of an economy, the elasticity of substitution between factors is high.

Labor shortages can be compensated for by capital (mechanization), and inadequate infrastructure can be covered by labor-intensive approaches. At this stage, investment functions as “bottleneck elimination (efficiency improvement),” and the economy achieves weighted average growth of factors.
$$
\text{Dominant Principle: Optimization}
$$


Phase II: The Realm of Saturation and Rigidity (Φ ≤ θ)

When the frontier reaches structural limits, substitution elasticity rapidly converges toward zero (rigidifies).

As human disposable time (the demand container) and physical space reach absolute limits, no amount of advanced capital investment can substitute for the deficient factors (time/labor).

At this stage, the economy takes on the nature of a Leontief-type production function (where factors are perfectly complementary), forcing an adjustment to “scale down (cut) the overall activity level according to the scarcest factor.”
$$
\text{Dominant Principle: Subtraction / Termination}
$$


I.2 Definition of Non-Cyclicity: Principle for Distinguishing Structural and Result Variables

Φ and its proxy indicator Φ̂ are not constructed using any of the following result variables:

- Actual Investment Ratio a
- Real GDP Growth Rate
- Success of Monetary Policy
- Asset Prices
- Overseas capital outflow

Therefore, the co-variation between Φ̂ and a is free from circular reasoning at the definition and indicator construction stage.

Furthermore, in this theory, the proxy indicators constituting the demand formation frontier Φ_demo are limited solely to variables directly based on physical and biological constraints.

(See II.10.3–II.10.4 for the epistemological organization and operationalization of Φ_demo)



I.3 Components of the Structural Frontier Φ

This paper defines the structural frontier coefficient Φ through the following three components.



I.3.1 Φ*real: Physical Capital Investment Margin *

*Φ*real is defined as the inverse (complement) of the saturation level of the existing capital stock (existing capital stock / theoretical saturation level), representing the margin for investment to be converted into new physical capital formation.



I.3.2 Φ_inst: Institutional and Expectation Formation Frontier This reflects the low level of regulatory barriers, stability of legal systems, ease of starting businesses and making investments, and an institutional environment where investors can stably form and update medium-to-long-term expectations.



I.3.3 Φ_demo: Demand Formation Frontier (Population and Time)

Φ_demo is a structural indicator representing the foundation upon which an economy can absorb real investment as effective demand. It indicates the scope for demand formation, determined not merely by population size but by the dynamics of the working-age population and constraints on disposable time. This paper positions Φ_demo as a structural variable representing the quantitative expandability of demand. Expansive interpretations concerning demand density and attention resources will be re-examined in II.3.3 and II.9.3.



I.4 Comprehensive Frontier Φ_total and Diagnostic Aggregation

[Organization] Φ = Structural variable a = Outcome variable Φ_return = Mediating variable
$$
\Phi_{\text{total}} = \min \left\{ \Phi_{\text{real}}, \Phi_{\text{inst}}, \Phi_{\text{demo}} \right\}
$$


Φ_return is a mediating outcome variable formally defined in the next section I.6.

Φ_total is not a variable directly determining growth rates or investment levels, but rather a diagnostic aggregate indicator for identifying which structural constraint is the dominant bottleneck in the given economy. In the regression analysis in the main text, each Φ_i is used individually, and Φ_total is used only in Appendix C to confirm the diagnostic robustness of the bottleneck hypothesis.

The general form is deferred to Appendix A.

(See Appendix B for the methodological positioning of the min approximation.)



I.5 Time Structure and Causal Direction Assumption

This theory assumes that the structural frontier influences investment allocation at least one period in advance, establishing the following causal direction:
$$
\Phi_{t-1} \;\rightarrow\; \alpha_t \;\rightarrow\; Y_t
$$


In empirical analysis, since α_t is not directly observable, we use a diagnostic estimate a_t constructed from observed statistics. For notation, we write:
$$
\Phi_{t-1} \;\rightarrow\; a_t \;\rightarrow\; Y_t
$$


In either case, reverse causality—where the investment allocation at a given time determines the past structural frontier—is theoretically excluded.

Figure I-1 conceptually illustrates the relationship between the structural frontier and causal analysis. Φ*real, Φ*inst, and Φ_demo are structural variables used in causal analysis, exhibiting unidirectional causality toward the realized investment allocation a.

I.6 Expected Return Frontier Φ_return (Mediating Variable)

The Φ_return discussed in this section is solely a result variable formed under structural frontier conditions; subsequent numerical references are for explanatory convenience only.

Definition: A mediating indicator representing the relative level of expected investment returns, formed endogenously given structural frontier conditions.

While Φ_return is a crucial variable directly influencing investment decisions, this theory does not include it as a component of the structural frontier Φ.

Examples of expressions include the difference between the real profit rate and the real interest rate, or the difference between ROE and the long-term government bond yield. Proxy indicators include Tobin's q minus 1, a firm's real profit rate, or the equity risk premium.

Economically, a positive Φ_return indicates investment is more advantageous than holding safe assets, while a negative value suggests holding cash or government bonds is rational.

Crucially, Φ_return is an endogenous outcome determined by Φ_real, Φ_inst, and Φ_demo, functioning as an intermediary variable linking structural conditions to the realized investment ratio a.



I.7 Critical Threshold θ and Policy Regime Shift

The critical threshold θ represents a theoretical boundary condition indicating that conventional macroeconomic theory and policy regimes fundamentally cease to hold when the structural frontier Φ falls below a certain level.
$$
\mathrm{IRF}_{Y}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) \approx 0 \quad \text{if } \Phi_{t-1} \le \theta
$$


Therefore, θ's role is not as a trigger determining the timing of policy activation, but is limited to serving as a diagnostic criterion indicating the existence of a region where a given policy becomes structurally invalid. This theory does not aim to “select the correct policy” using θ, but positions it as a framework to exclude erroneous policy choices within the region below θ.

θ possesses a dual nature. First, as a structural property, θ is a structural constant determined by deep-seated conditions such as demographics, industrial composition, and financial structure; it is not altered by short-term policy manipulation. This paper assumes that within the analysis period, θ is short-term invariant and unresponsive to policy manipulation:
$$
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial M_t} = 0, \qquad \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} \approx 0
$$


Second, as an epistemological property, the specific level of θ is not directly observable a priori. It is only identified a posteriori as the point where policy effects undergo a qualitative transformation accompanying changes in the structural frontier Φ. θ is not an operable threshold for precisely predicting future turning points; it is a concept identified through qualitative shifts in economic behavior. This a posteriori identification does not diminish θ's diagnostic utility.

The critical threshold θ in this theory represents the “structure” of a structural phase transition point common to all economies. However, its specific level may vary across countries, as it is determined by each economy's unique deep structure—such as population composition, financial market depth, industrial structure, and the degree of freedom in international capital flows. The universality asserted by this theory pertains not to the numerical value of θ itself, but to the very structure whereby policy effects undergo a qualitative transformation when Φ falls below the θ inherent to that economy.

Based on the above, this paper defines the case where Φ > θ as the “monetary policy effective zone” and the case where Φ ≤ θ as the “investment trap (monetary policy ineffective zone)”. This distinction is not an arbitrarily drawn boundary by analysts, but a diagnostic classification based on the phase transition point inherent within the economic structure.



# **Part II: Operationalization and Identification Strategy**

II.0 Purpose and Positioning of Part II

Part II organizes the structural frontier Φ and critical threshold θ defined in Part I within their correspondence to observable economic phenomena, connecting them to an empirically diagnosable identification strategy.

Specifically, it presents identification strategies to diagnose the relative positions of Φ and θ using the asymmetry of policy responses based on existing statistics such as employment, growth, wages, and prices. The approach employed here is structural identification, utilizing the simultaneous fulfillment of multiple, definitionally independent conditions, rather than reverse-engineering structural variables from outcome variables.

Furthermore, the latter part of Section II and Appendices A and B explicitly state methodological limitations regarding the operationalization of structural indicators. Specifically, for the demand formation frontier Φ_demo, we distinguish between essential indicators (Tier 1) and supplementary indicators (Tier 2) used in the main text, aiming to unambiguously identify situations where structural constraints become dominant.



II.1 Basic Setting of the Identification Problem

II.1.1 Identification Method for the Structural Frontier Coefficient Φ and Critical Threshold θ

Below, we present an identification strategy that exploits asymmetries in the responses of interest rate policy, employment, growth, and inflation.



II.1.2 Basic Identification Concept

The structural frontier coefficient Φ is a potential structural variable that comprehensively represents the capacity for real investment absorption.

 A key premise of this theory is that monetary policy affects the economy through multiple channels, but these channels depend asymmetrically on Φ.

Specifically, the following two points are assumed:

- The employment channel of monetary policy operates relatively stably, independent of the level of Φ.
- The growth channel of monetary policy functions effectively only when Φ exceeds θ.

This asymmetry contains the information necessary to distinguish between Φ and θ.



II.2 Upper and Lower Bound Constraints via Employment and Growth Responses

This section uses the responses of employment and growth to monetary policy to impose upper and lower bound constraints on the structural frontier Φ.



II.2.1 Lower Bound Information from Employment Response

If employment indicators (unemployment rate, number of employed persons, etc.) show statistically significant improvement in response to monetary easing, it is interpreted that the employment channel of monetary policy is functioning during that period. This observation implies that the structural frontier Φ is not near zero but exceeds at least a lower bound that permits employment improvement.
$$
N_t = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \Delta M_t + \gamma_2 Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{N,t}
$$


Here, an observation of γ₁ ≠ 0 provides the lower bound constraint Φ > Φ_min, but this information alone cannot determine the level of Φ or its relative position to θ.



II.2.2 Upper Bound Constraint via Growth Response

Conversely, if the real GDP growth rate shows no statistically significant response despite monetary easing, the growth channel of monetary policy is interpreted as being ineffective. This theory positions this situation as an indication that Φ has fallen below the critical threshold θ.
$$
g_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\Phi_{t-1}) \cdot \Delta M_t + \beta_2 X_t + \varepsilon_{g,t}
$$

$$
\beta_1(\Phi_{t-1}) = \begin{cases} \beta_{\max} > 0 & \text{if } \Phi_{t-1} > \theta \\ \approx 0 & \text{if } \Phi_{t-1} \leq \theta \end{cases}
$$


That is, the observed fact that “monetary easing affects employment but not growth” imposes an upper bound constraint Φ ≤ θ.

From the above, we see that Φ lies between the “lower bound where employment improves” and the “upper limit where growth is nullified.” However, at this stage, the distance between Φ and θ remains unspecified.



II.3 Frontier Volatility, Breakdown, and Phase Transitions

Changes in structural variables occur more slowly than policy variables but can appear discontinuously relative to outcome variables, signifying structural change.

The structural frontier coefficient Φ, a core concept in this theory, is not a fixed structural parameter but a potential constraint variable that fluctuates over time depending on demographic trends, institutional environments, real investment opportunities, and the international economic environment. Φ is not an infinitely expandable variable; it has an upper limit determined by the structural conditions of each economy.



II.4 Discontinuity of Breakdown

Consequently, when a specific structural element falls below its threshold due to internal or external shocks, the overall Φ value declines sharply, even if other elements remain relatively sound.

Such a “breakdown” of the structural frontier coefficient manifests not as a continuous adjustment process, but as a discontinuous structural transformation. When a breakdown occurs, stagnation in real investment, distortions in credit allocation, and a decline in expected rates of return progress simultaneously, leading to a coordinated deterioration across investment, growth, and financial aspects throughout the entire economy. Consequently, even a single shock causes mutually amplified damage, and economic losses expand nonlinearly.

Thus, this theory provides a framework for understanding economic crises and prolonged stagnation not merely as outcomes of debt levels or short-term shocks, but as consequences of a volatile, bounded structural frontier coefficient crossing a critical threshold.



II.5 Basic Principles for Operationalizing Φ

II.5.1 Operational Definition of Φ_real

Φ_real (the real frontier) is a structural indicator representing the scope for investment to translate into expansion of the real capital stock. The real frontier is defined as follows, based on how close the existing capital stock is to its theoretical saturation level:
$$
\Phi_{\text{real}} = 1 - \frac{\text{Existing Capital Stock}}{\text{Theoretical Saturation Level}}
$$


Since Φ_real cannot be directly observed, proxy variables are used to approximate it.

Economically, the closer Φreal is to 1, the greater the physical investment potential, typical of emerging economies or post-war reconstruction phases. Conversely, as Φreal approaches 0, it indicates characteristics of a mature economy with progressing infrastructure saturation and excess capacity. As a concrete example, postwar Japan, against a backdrop of destroyed capital stock and rapid population growth, can be assessed as having possessed an extremely high Φreal. In contrast, in modern Japan, the number of dwellings per household is approximately 1.16, and the vacancy rate has reached about 13.6%. Judging from these indicators, Φreal is considered to be in the “middle group” among advanced nations.

II.5.2 Operational Definition of Φ_inst

Φ_inst (Institutional and Expectation Formation Frontier)

Definition: The degree to which investment is not hindered by institutional or regulatory barriers and investment expectations are stably formed and updated. Conceptually represented by the following function

Φ_inst = f(Entrepreneurial Rate, Inverse of Regulatory Costs, Policy Continuity, Legal Stability, Institutional Stability of Expectation Formation)

Proxy indicators include the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index, days/costs required to start a new business, policy consistency, and frequency of institutional changes.

(※As this index is no longer updated, use is limited to the final year available)



II.5.3 Theoretical Definition of Φ_demo

Φ_demo (the demand formation frontier, hereafter “population-time frontier”) represents a structural constraint indicating the scope within which additional real investment can be absorbed as effective demand in the real economy. In this theory, Φ_demo is defined not merely as population size or income level, but as a qualitative constraint determined by the time resources and attention resources that humans can consume and enjoy within a given period.

Theoretically, Φ_demo consists of the following three layers: (i) Population quantity (quantity) (ii) Disposable time (time constraint) (iii) Density constraints related to attention/consumption saturation (attention / saturation)

The Φ̂*demo used in empirical analysis is an ordered scale constructed based on multiple observable indicators that indirectly reflect demand absorption capacity, such as time-use surveys, working hour distributions, dynamics of the working-age population, and density indicators of consumption expenditure. The purpose of this paper is not to measure the absolute level of Φ_demo, but to identify whether countries and time periods are approaching the constrained region of the demand formation frontier.

Φdemo primarily represents quantitative demand expansion potential dependent on population growth, making it inherently constrained under population decline. However, this does not negate possibilities for qualitative growth or advanced investment. Even in economies where Φdemo declines, investment potential based on renewal, efficiency improvements, and institutional reforms—captured by Φ*real and Φ*inst—can still exist.



II.5.4 Operationalization of Φ̂_demo

Following the non-cyclical principle in I.2, Φ̂_demo is limited to indicators based on population and time constraints, excluding output and price series.

Therefore, Tier 1 indicators for Φ̂_demo are defined as independent indices composed solely of: (1) deterministic trends in the working-age population, and (2) residual disposable free time based on national time-use surveys.

This paper organizes the operationalization of Φ̂_demo into the following two tiers.

Tier 1 (Essential Indicators)

Tier 1 comprises indicators that directly represent the “quantitative demand absorption capacity” and “temporal constraints” forming the core of the demand formation frontier. These are deemed essential for both theoretical necessity and international comparability in the analysis and empirical tests presented in this paper.

Specifically, the following two indicators are used:

(i) Quantitative Demand Expansion Term (D_quantity)

Growth rate of the working-age population (15–64 years old)

These indicators are directly grounded in biological and physical constraints—population size and human disposable time—and thus exhibit relatively small distortions from institutional or preference differences.

Therefore, the proxy indicator for the demand formation frontier in this paper's main body is constructed based solely on the following Tier 1 indicators:
$$
\hat{\Phi}_{demo}^{(Tier1)} = w_1 \cdot T_{constraint} + w_2 \cdot D_{quantity}, \quad w_i > 0
$$


Each term is a normalized ordinal scale between 0 and 1. This paper's diagnostic empirical analysis uses only relative positions, not absolute levels.

Tier 2 (Supplementary Indicators)

Conversely, constraints on demand formation may also be influenced by supplementary factors such as consumption structure and the prevalence of goods.

These are approximated by the following indicators:

- Consumption Saturation
- Durable Goods Penetration Rate

However, these indicators are highly dependent on each country's consumption culture, institutions, and technological level, and suffer from significant measurement errors and definitional vagueness. Therefore, they are not used for the main identification and diagnostic empirical analysis in this paper.

Time Constraint Term T_constraint
$$
T_{constraint} = 1 - \frac{\text{Free Time}}{\text{Total Disposable Time}}
$$


- Free time is based on time use surveys such as the OECD Time Use Database
- A higher value indicates tighter constraints on time available for consumption and service enjoyment

This term reflects the core assertion of this theory: constraints on disposable time limit demand absorption.

Quantitative Demand Expansion Term D_quantity
$$
D_{quantity} = \text{Working-age population growth rate}
$$


- Changes in the working-age population (e.g., 15–64 years) approximate
  - quantitative demand expansion potential
  - and the possibility of new market formation.



II.5.5 Scope and Limitations of This Operationalization

For its intended purposes, this operationalization provides sufficient information for:

- International comparisons
- Time-series comparisons
- Regime identification

This paper limits its analysis to Tier 1 indicators not to capture all aspects of the demand formation frontier, but to robustly identify situations where structural constraints become dominant.

Tier 2 indicators are useful for supplementary diagnostics and sensitivity analysis but are addressed in the appendix.



II.6 Determining Short-Term Fluctuations and Timing of Business Cycles

This theory aims to identify conditions under which investment and policy can function effectively based on the level of the structural frontier coefficient Φ. Therefore, it does not directly explain “when” or “at what timing” business cycles occur, nor the short-term amplitude of their fluctuations. These phenomena depend heavily on short-term factors such as credit behavior, expectation formation, and financial market dynamics. This theory treats these as given and analyzes how their outcomes are constrained by structural limitations.

II.6.1 Selection of Investment Targets and Individual Bubble Formation Processes

This theory can explain the tendency for surplus funds, under conditions of structural constraints, to flow into asset markets or abroad rather than being absorbed by real investment. However, it falls outside the scope of this theory to explain the specific selection processes—such as why particular assets (real estate, stocks, crypto assets, etc.) are preferred as investment targets, or in which markets bubbles form. These depend heavily on micro-level and institutional factors like information asymmetry, imitation behavior, and institutional practices.



II.6.2 The Occurrence of Technological Innovation Itself and Its Contingency

This theory can organize how technological innovation changes the structural frontier coefficient Φ after it is realized. However, it does not explain the origin itself—why and when a specific technological innovation occurs. The emergence of technological innovation relies heavily on chance and the exploration process; this theory treats it as an exogenous shock. 



II.6.3 Differences Between Countries and Entities Under Identical Structural Conditions

Despite similar population structures and institutional environments, differences in economic outcomes can arise between countries and firms. While this theory can explicitly identify structural constraints, it does not directly explain factors like behavioral differences, the skill of policy implementation, or the quality of managerial decisions that arise under identical structural conditions. These issues belong to the domains of political culture, organizational behavior, and historical path dependence. 



II.6.4 Post-hoc Evaluation of Low-Probability Events and Exceptional Success

Since this theory primarily focuses on identifying structural conditions that generally render policies or investments ineffective, exceptional successes occurring with low probability and the selection of success cases observed retrospectively (survivor bias) require careful handling. These events do not negate this theory; they are positioned as issues of probabilistic and retrospective evaluation.



II.6.5 Individual Agents as Initiators of Structural Change

While instances exist where specific firms or individuals significantly alter industrial structures or market environments, this theory does not explain why these actors were selected or their decision-making processes. This theory addresses how such changes, once occurring, subsequently impact the structural frontier.



Appendix A: Auxiliary Constraints on the Demand Formation Frontier (Tier 2 Indicators)

Appendix A.0 Purpose and Positioning of Appendix A

Appendix A examines consumption saturation and durable goods penetration rate as supplementary factors (Tier 2) that may influence the demand formation frontier, in addition to the Tier 1 indicators used in the main text.

This appendix provides supplementary analysis on the relationship between consumption saturation and durable goods penetration rate—not used in the main text—and the demand formation frontier.



Appendix A.1 Supplementary Assessment of Demand Constraints via Consumption Saturation (Tier 2)

This appendix introduces “consumption capacity” as a factor that can supplementarily characterize the demand formation frontier Φ_demo, in addition to the Tier 1 indicators (population and time) used in the main text. Here, capacity refers to the aspect where the scope for absorbing additional supply and investment as demand is constrained by the penetration of durable goods and the saturation of living infrastructure. 

 Crucially, the purpose of this paper is not to precisely measure welfare or satisfaction, but to unambiguously identify the phase where structural constraints become dominant (Φ ≤ θ). Therefore, the indicators introduced in this supplementary section are not used for the main identification in the main text but are positioned as auxiliary diagnostics (sensitivity analysis).

Supplementary Section A.1.1 Definition of the Consumption Saturation Term (Example)

The consumption saturation term D_capacity is defined as follows (example):

Consumption Saturation Term D_capacity
$$
D_{capacity} = 1 - \text {Durable Goods Penetration Rate}
$$


- The higher the penetration rate of durable goods (such as automobiles, major home appliances, and housing equipment), the more limited the potential benefits from additional purchases or the scope for creating new demand may become.
- D_capacity is an auxiliary indicator that roughly approximates the “physical scope” for demand formation or the “expansion potential beyond replacement demand.”

Note: The durable goods penetration rate may be influenced by country-specific culture, definitions, and statistical consistency. Therefore, it is not treated as a mandatory series like the Tier 1 indicators in the main text. Where necessary, consistency should be verified with alternative series such as housing stock saturation, household durable goods holdings, or infrastructure renewal rates.



Appendix A.2 Structural Frontier Aggregation and min Approximation: Logical Justification via the Minimal Model

The purpose of this section is not to introduce the min function as a “permanently valid production function.” In mature/constrained regimes (Φ ≤ θ), the viability of investment projects often depends on the simultaneous fulfillment of multiple conditions (necessary conditions), and the elasticity of substitution between factors rapidly declines. We clarify that the min approximation is used to diagnostically express this limit state.



Appendix A.2.1: Investment Project Viability Depends on Simultaneous Conditions (AND Conditions)

In mature economies, constraints on real investment often shift from the volume of funds itself to the effective volume of viable investment projects. During phases with significant quantitative growth potential, numerous new markets emerge. Even when multiple firms expand simultaneously, the demand capacity expands, making it easier for capital supply to be channeled into real investment. In contrast, during the mature stage, market expansion primarily depends on qualitative advancement. However, constraints like the demand capacity, institutional conditions, and supply capabilities are difficult to expand in the short term, making investment resemble a “scramble for available slots.”

At this point, even if capital exists, investment projects will not materialize unless the following conditions are simultaneously met (if any one is missing, the NPV approaches zero, and the project does not proceed):

- Φ_real: Real-world capacity (location, infrastructure, room for renewal, supply capacity)
- Φ_inst: Institutional framework and predictability (regulatory continuity, policy stability, legal certainty)
- Φ_demo: Demand capacity (absorption potential based on population, time, and density)

Let the effective quantity of viable projects be Φ*eff,t*. Real investment is proportional to this Φeff,t, not to the amount of funds:
$$
I^{real}_t = \Phi_{eff,t}\cdot G(\text{funds}_t), \quad G'(\cdot)>0
$$


The crucial point here is that even if funds increase, real investment does not increase if Φ_eff,t is low. In mature phases, project constraints tend to dominate over funding constraints, leading to the conclusion that monetary easing is less likely to translate into real investment.



Appendix A.2.2 Relationship between General Form (soft-min) and Limit (min)

Φ_eff should generally be represented by a continuous aggregation function. To represent phases where substitution elasticity declines, this paper adopts the low-substitution CES (soft-min) as the general form:
$$
\Phi_{eff,t} = \left( \sum_{i\in\{real,inst,demo\}} w_i\,\Phi_{i,t}^{-\rho} \right)^{-1/\rho}, \quad w_i>0
$$


In mature/constrained regimes, substitution elasticity can significantly decrease due to strengthened necessity conditions, convex cost functions for substitutes, and short-term rigidity at bottlenecks. Considering the limit as ρ → ∞,
$$
\lim_{\rho\to\infty} \left( \sum_i w_i\,\Phi_{i}^{-\rho} \right)^{-1/\rho} = \min\{\Phi_i\}
$$


holds. That is, the min function does not always assume perfect complementarity; it is a diagnostic approximation representing the limit of low substitutability in the mature-constrained regime.



Appendix A.2.3 Application Conditions for min Approximation (Diagnostic Constraints)

This paper assumes the min approximation is valid when the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:

・Φ ≤ θ (the structural frontier is constrained)

・A specific Φ_i is a clear bottleneck

・Short-term improvement of this bottleneck is difficult

When these conditions are not met, treating it as soft-min (with finite ρ) is appropriate. Note that in the main text, Φ_total is not used as the primary explanatory variable for causal inference or prediction; min (or soft-min) is used solely as a diagnostic rule to identify the dominant constraint.

Note: In the main text of this paper, Φ_total is not used as the primary explanatory variable for causal inference or prediction. min (or soft-min) is positioned as a diagnostic rule to identify which factor is the dominant bottleneck.



Appendix A.3 Density-Dependent CES and the “Low Substitutability Regime” Hypothesis

The hypothesis that as maturation (frontier depletion) progresses, substitution between factors becomes less likely to function smoothly is expressed as follows:
$$
\Phi_{eff,t} = \left( \sum_i w_i\,\Phi_{i,t}^{-\rho(D_t)} \right)^{-1/\rho(D_t)}
$$


Here, \(D\) represents a conceptual indicator of the economy's density (degree of frontier depletion), and the substitution parameter \(\rho(D)\) is assumed to increase as \(D\) rises.

During the growth stage (low D), ρ(D) is small, and substitution between factors functions relatively smoothly. Conversely, in the mature/constrained regime (high D), ρ(D) increases, causing substitution elasticity to decline significantly. Considering the limit as ρ(D) → ∞, Φ converges to the min approximation used in Appendix A.2.2.

In this sense, the min aggregation in this paper is not a production function that holds at all times, but is positioned as a diagnostic limit that occurs when the necessary condition structure becomes dominant in the mature/constrained regime.



Appendix A.4 Empirical Implications Regarding the Critical Threshold θ

In this theory, the critical threshold θ is defined as a structural phase transition point inherent in each economy. The fact that the specific level of θ may differ across countries does not imply that this theory treats θ as a variable policy parameter. Rather, this level difference reflects variations in deep structural conditions such as demographic trends, industrial composition, financial structure, and the degree of international capital mobility.

The focus of this theory is not on estimating the country-specific level of θ as an explanatory variable, but on describing the universality of the structure itself: when the structural frontier Φ falls below the θ inherent in a given economy, the effects of monetary policy undergo a qualitative shift.

Historical data and cross-country analysis repeatedly show that when the structural frontier falls below a certain level, the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy tends to weaken significantly. This paper refers to this transition point as the critical frontier density θ.

Theoretically, Φ is thought to have a structure where the effects of monetary policy diverge into two distinct policy regimes at an unknown critical threshold θ. The empirical implication of this paper centers on whether the existence of this regime shift can be confirmed in a manner consistent with the observed data.



Appendix A.5 Note on the Scope of Empirical Analysis

This paper aims to present a theoretical framework for diagnostically organizing structural constraints (frontiers) and regime shifts in policy effects; it does not attempt a final verification through complete econometric empirical analysis. However, this theory is falsifiable in principle, and empirical challenges such as validating the proxy indicators and statistically identifying regime shifts are left to future research.



Appendix B: Methodological Rationale for Adopting the min Function

Appendix B.1 Why Use the min Function: Theoretical Basis for Bottleneck Structure

This paper formulates the general form of the structural frontier as a density-dependent, low-substitutability CES function. The min function used in the analysis does not assume this general form as a constant. The min function is adopted as a diagnostic upper bound approximation that becomes effective when focusing on situations where substitution elasticity significantly declines in the mature phase (Φ ≤ θ).

Therefore, this paper does not assume that the min function “always holds.” The min function serves as a tool to identify which constraint element functions as the dominant bottleneck when the analysis is confined to the regime where structural constraints govern investment decisions.



Appendix B.1.1 The min Function as a Limit Approximation

The comprehensive structural frontier Φ is composed of multiple sub-frontiers (Φ*real, Φ*inst, Φ_demo, etc.), but this theory does not assume they are always perfectly complementary.

The min function is derived in the following sense.

- In the CES-type aggregate function
- At the limit where substitution elasticity drastically declines (ρ→∞)

, the structural frontier is approximately dominated by the most constrained factor.

That is, the claim of this theory is the following conditional proposition:

In a mature economy where investment opportunities face structural constraints, the elasticity of substitution between factors rapidly diminishes, and a situation where the most constrained factor effectively determines the economy's overall investment potential becomes dominant.

The min function serves as an approximate representation to concisely express such a low-substitutability regime.



Appendix B.1.2: Use as Structural Diagnosis, Not Causal Analysis

Crucially, this paper does not employ the min function as the primary engine for causal inference or prediction. The role of the min function is strictly limited to the following two points:

- Identifying which structural element is the dominant bottleneck in the given economy
- Identifying whether the economy is transitioning from an “efficiency regime” to a “reduction (contraction) regime”

It serves as a structural diagnostic tool.

This limitation means the min function is not intended to be interpreted as a production function or a forecasting function. It is positioned as a methodological approximation to explicitly reveal the location of structural constraints in the mature phase.



Appendix B.1.3 Note (Definitional Limitations)

The min function used herein is not a function that directly generates output, growth rates, or investment levels. It is a diagnostic approximation for identifying the structural factors that most strongly constrain investment formation in the mature phase.



Appendix B.2 Continuity vs. Discontinuity: Phase Transitions in Economic Theory

Many standard economic models tend to treat change continuously for analytical convenience. However, in reality, phenomena exist that transition to qualitatively different states upon crossing a critical threshold.

Examples:

- Bank runs: Occur suddenly at a specific point in time
- Financial crises: Manifest abruptly, not gradually
- Network externalities: Expand rapidly upon exceeding a critical adoption rate

The min function in this theory is a theoretical choice designed to express such “threshold effects.”



Appendix B.3 Theoretical Framework for Unmeasurability

This section explicitly outlines the epistemological foundations of ‘unmeasurability’ and ‘diagnostic limitations’ discussed in Appendix B.

A defining feature of this theory is positioning the fact that “Φ is difficult to measure” not as a theoretical flaw, but as a central tenet.

Knight (1921) pointed out that uncertainty resides in a realm where markets cannot assign prices. He made the following distinction:

- Risk: Probability distribution is known → Measurable → Tradable in markets
- Uncertainty: Probability distribution is unknown → Unmeasurable → Market failure

The theory's assertion:

- Φ > θ: The realm of risk (investable)
- Φ ≤ θ: The realm of uncertainty (uninvestable)

Therefore, the inability to precisely measure Φ precisely explains “why investment does not occur.”



Appendix B.4: A Posteriori Identification and Falsifiability (Addendum: Replacement)

The fact that θ can only be identified ex post does not imply unpredictability.

Rather, this theory is accompanied by the following testable predictions:

1. The effect of monetary easing changes discontinuously at a certain point.
2. Before and after this change point, the reaction of the investment allocation a to monetary policy is qualitatively different.
3. Only improvements in bottleneck factors increase a.

These are econometrically testable, and the theory satisfies falsifiability (Popper 1959).

Furthermore, this theory possesses clear refutation conditions under which the above predictions can be explicitly rejected. Specifically, if the following observed facts are robustly confirmed, the central propositions of this theory (regime shifts via Φ and θ, and bottleneck rate-limiting) lose support.

(R1) Despite Φ̂ declining, the response of real investment (I_real) and growth to monetary policy shocks remains robustly positive and sustained.

(R2) Despite the bottleneck factor (minimum Φ_i) remaining unchanged, a continues to rise steadily (i.e., investment allocation improves continuously through improvements in non-bottleneck factors alone).

(R3) Within the same country, despite proxy variables for institutions, population, and capital stock being stable, only the regime classification frequently reverses (diagnosis is unstable and unconstrained by structural conditions).

Therefore, this theory can be positioned as a framework that simultaneously possesses explicit predictions and explicit falsification conditions, even under the constraint that “θ is only identifiable a posteriori.”



# **Part III: Design and Selection of Diagnostic Indicators**

III.0 Purpose of the Diagnostic Module 

This section provides a framework for classifying whether the target period is consistent with the “valid zone (Φ > θ)”, ‘neighborhood’, or “invalid zone (Φ ≤ θ)”, using a diagnostic module composed of observable reaction patterns and fund flow statistics. It does not aim to point-estimate the structural frontier coefficient Φ and critical threshold θ.



III.1 Regime Classification of Policy Effects: Diagnostic Tree (Operational Procedure)

This section presents a classification procedure (diagnostic tree) based on observable reaction patterns. Formal conditional expressions (C_U, C_Y, A_κ, C_κ, S_θ) and threshold/out-of-scope (N.A.) rules are summarized in III.3.2. The estimation regression specification for κ is summarized in III.4. The tolerance bands δ, ε, τ used here are not intended for point estimation but are parameters for classification operations (formulae in Section III.3.2).



Step 0 Prerequisite: Is the monetary policy transmission mechanism functioning?

Confirm whether the cumulative response of employment (or unemployment rate) to a monetary policy shock is significantly different from zero (P_M).

Employment responds clearly (P_M satisfied): Transmission mechanism is functioning. Proceed to Step 1.

Employment does not respond (P_M not satisfied): Treat as “Policy Shock Identification/Transmission Failure (Out of scope)” and exclude from this diagnosis. (Suspect credit crunch, impaired financial intermediation, etc.)

 

Step 1 Identification Condition: Is full employment (or near full employment) achieved?

Confirm whether the unemployment rate is near the natural rate of unemployment (C_U).

Full employment is achieved (C_U satisfied): The aggregate demand deficiency regime is excluded. Proceed to Step 2.

Full employment is not achieved (C_U not satisfied): Classify as a “Total Demand Shortfall Regime.” Standard Keynesian policy is likely effective during this period; exclude it from structural constraint diagnosis.



Step 2: Primary Symptom — Is the Growth Channel Active? Confirm whether the cumulative response of real GDP (or real growth) to a monetary policy shock is near zero (C_Y as defined in III.3.2).

- Growth clearly responds (does not satisfy C_Y): This period is likely consistent with the “effective zone (Φ > θ)”.
- Growth does not respond (satisfies C_Y): This period is likely consistent with the “ineffective zone (Φ ≤ θ)”. Proceed to Step 3.



Step 3: Verify Escape Routes: Are Alternative Channels Active? If growth does not respond in Step 2, verify whether funds are flowing into alternative channels rather than the real economy (criteria defined in III.3.1 and III.3.2). Typical examples include asset prices, overseas investment, retained earnings, M&A, and share buybacks.

- Alternative channels react: Classify as “Growth channel ineffective / Balance sheet/price (etc.) channel effective.” This is consistent with structural constraints (lack of investment outlets).
- Alternative channels also fail to react: Reserve the possibility of credit intermediation channel impairment (financial stress branch) or deep constraint zone (Φ ≪ θ), and branch based on auxiliary conditions in III.3.3.



Step 4 Auxiliary Symptoms: Near θ, Deeper Constraints, or Exogenous Shocks? Separate near θ, deep constraints, and exogenous supply shocks using auxiliary symptoms related to employment, wages, and prices (judgment criteria are C_U, A_κ, C_κ, S_θ from III.3.2).

- Employment is improving but growth is unresponsive (satisfies C_U and C_Y): Typical candidate for near θ.
- Price/wage response is also weak, and monetary easing does not lead to inflation (determined by auxiliary conditions): Candidate for deeper constraint region (Φ ≪ θ).
- Price increases are driven by exogenous factors (Z) such as import prices, energy, or taxes (e.g., Z's contribution is large in windowed regression): Isolate as an exogenous supply shock branch and treat separately from the structural constraint regime.



III.1.1 Detailed Conditions (Three-Condition Pattern as Auxiliary Score)

This section does not aim to numerically identify a single critical threshold θ. Instead, it verbalizes “diagnostic signatures” (sets of symptoms likely to occur near θ) as an operational checklist. Formal definitions, threshold parameters, and treatment of out-of-scope cases (N.A.) are consolidated in Section III.3.2.

The θ-proximity diagnosis in this paper is based on the following three-condition pattern.

- Primary Identification (Tier 1): Vanishing Growth Effect The central symptom of the θ-proximity diagnosis is that the real economy's growth response to a monetary policy shock becomes near zero (or is effectively negligible).
- Auxiliary Diagnosis (Tier 2-1): Full Employment (or Tight Labor Market) The observation that the non-responsive growth phase occurs not merely during a recessionary period of insufficient demand, but rather when employment has already improved (or is tight), serves as supplementary evidence supporting the consistency of θ proximity.
- Supplementary Diagnosis (Tier 2-2): Cost-Push Proximity (Proximity to Reference Pass-Through Level) An estimated cost-push coefficient derived from the relationship between prices and wages being close to the reference pass-through level for the given country/system serves as supplementary evidence for θ proximity. However, this supplementary diagnosis can only be evaluated when sufficient wage and price fluctuations exist for estimation. For windows with insufficient variation, treat this condition as “Not Applicable (N.A.)” and prioritize diagnostics for alternative channels (Step 3) (details in III.3.2).

The above three conditions constitute the elements forming the “diagnostic signature” for θ proximity. The exact operational rules, including the definition formula for the signature indicator (S_θ) itself and the applicability conditions for κ estimation, are provided in III.3.2.

 (Optional Auxiliary Diagnosis) Furthermore, asymmetric reactions where funds flow disproportionately into asset prices rather than real investment serve as auxiliary evidence suggesting a higher likelihood of “insufficient investment outlets (structural constraints)” rather than “funding shortage.” The definition and treatment of this auxiliary condition are also summarized in Section III.3.2.



III.2 Causal Structure and Testable Propositions

III.2.1 Operational Definition of α and Diagnostic Estimation Value a

a is not a transaction-level determination of speculation but a diagnostic proxy constructed from observable series.

The realized investment ratio α in this theory conceptually refers to “the ratio of supplied funds converted into real investment.” However, it is generally impossible to distinguish at the transaction level whether individual fund flows represent real investment or asset transactions/holdings (non-real uses that may include speculation). Therefore, this paper defines the estimated value of the realized investment ratio, a, as a diagnostic estimate limited to observable fund flows and non-financial asset formation, without performing speculation identification.

 The definitions of the debt/securities issuance and investment series are as follows. First, ΔDebt_t represents the net increase in non-securitized liabilities (loans, etc.). Therefore, securitized liabilities corresponding to corporate bonds are not included in ΔDebt_t; instead, they are separately tracked as net bond issuance via NetBond_t (issuance minus redemptions). Equity financing is represented by NetEquity_t (net issuance including the net effect of capital increases minus share buybacks). Furthermore, other financing is recorded as ΔOtherFin_t only when statistically identifiable and available.

Hereafter, tangible fixed asset investment (excluding intangible assets) is denoted as Capex^tang_t, intangible asset investment as Capex^intan_t, and net inventory increase as ΔInventories_t. In principle, the corporate sector's real investment (observable non-financial asset formation) is defined as follows:
$$
I^{\text{real}}_t \equiv \text{Capex}^{\text{tang}}_t + \Delta \text{Inventories}_t + \text{Capex}^{\text{intan}}_t
$$


However, if the statistical series definition used treats Capex_t as a combined tangible and intangible investment series, to avoid double counting, Capex^intan_t is not added separately. Instead, the definition of real investment is reinterpreted as:
$$
I^{\text{real}}_t \equiv \text{Capex}_t + \Delta \text{Inventories}_t
$$


In this case, Capex_t is used as the combined tangible and intangible investment series, and Capex^tang_t and Capex^intan_t are not used.

At this point, two types of realized investment ratio a are defined as diagnostic estimates.

First, the external-funding-based diagnostic ratio (external version):
$$
\Delta F^{\text{ext}}_{t} \equiv \Delta \text{Debt}_{t} + \text{NetBond}_{t} + \text{NetEquity}_{t} + \Delta \text{OtherFin}_{t}
$$

$$
\hat{\alpha}^{\text{ext}}_{t} \equiv a^{\text{ext}}_{t} = \frac{I^{\text{real}}_{t}}{\Delta F^{\text{ext}}_{t}} \quad (\Delta F^{\text{ext}}_{t}>0 \text{ is interpreted around the period})
$$


Here, CF_t represents the internal funds flow of the corporate sector. In implementation, it is defined based on available statistics as one of the following: (a) National Accounts (SNA) basis: The retained earnings equivalent amount, calculated by subtracting interest and dividend payments from the corporate sector's gross disposable income (or operating surplus, etc.), plus fixed capital consumption (CFC). (b) Corporate Accounting Statistics (CAS) basis: approximated as after-tax profits + depreciation (adjusted for provisions, etc., if necessary). This paper does not aim for a strict estimation of CF_t but adopts a consistent definition as a reproducible proxy across countries and statistics.

Second, the diagnostic ratio based on total funds (total funds version), which includes both external and internal funds:
$$
\Delta F^{\text{tot}}_{t} \equiv \Delta F^{\text{ext}}_{t} + CF_ {t}
$$

$$
\hat{\alpha}^{\text{tot}}_{t} \equiv a^{\text{tot}}_{t} = \frac{I^{\text{real}}_{t}}{\Delta F^{\text{tot}}_{t}} = \frac{I^{\text{real}}_{t}}{\Delta F^{\text{ext}}_{t} + CF_{t}} \quad (\Delta F^{tot}_t \le 0 \text{ periods are treated as missing data outside the scope of application})
$$


However, to suppress short-term noise from business cycles, a is applied as a moving average (e.g., 4 quarters) or a rank indicator based on quantiles.

In this paper, a^tot_t is primarily used as the main diagnostic indicator in the main text, recognizing that corporate funding constraints are not solely determined by external financing (as retained earnings and depreciation can serve as primary sources for real investment). a^ext_t is used for robustness checks and supplementary comparisons.

Furthermore, the ratio of total funds not converted into real investment is treated as residual:
$$
\hat{s}^{tot}_t = 1 - a^{tot}_t \quad (\text{Similarly } \hat{s}^{ext}_t = 1-a^{ext}_t)
$$


Here, ŝ does not directly imply “speculation.” It represents the observed non-real allocation portion, encompassing diverse non-real uses such as cash accumulation, financial asset acquisition, dividends/share buybacks, and overseas investment. Therefore, a is not a strict estimate but is used as an ordinal/diagnostic proxy for structural regime identification.



III.2.2 Theoretical Causality

The core claim of this theory lies in a unidirectional causal relationship where structural conditions influence investment allocation ex ante. Specifically, each element constituting the structural frontier affects the realized investment ratio a with a certain time lag.

When structural conditions are favorable, real investment opportunities are relatively abundant. Consequently, additional credit supply tends to be allocated toward real investment, leading to a high value of a. Conversely, when structural conditions are restrictive, real investment opportunities are scarce. Credit supply then tends to manifest as inflows into asset markets or capital outflows abroad, causing a to decline.

The expected rate of return on investment formed in this process is an endogenous intermediate variable determined given the structural frontier conditions and is distinct from the structural conditions themselves.

The causal relationships described above can be verified using time series and cross-country data as the relationship between each element constituting the structural frontier and a.



III.2.3 Endogenous Constraints on Φ_demo

Once an economy surpasses a certain stage of development, population growth slows or declines, while demand expansion increasingly relies on qualitative and density-enhancing directions that increase value per unit time. However, such increases in demand density tend to rapidly raise marginal costs under the constraint of finite human disposable time.

Therefore, even with a stable population, a certain investment margin may exist due to demand sophistication, but its substitutability is limited and it does not possess growth absorption capacity equivalent to quantitative expansion (population growth). When an economy reaches a stage where it internally incorporates demographic constraints, demand-side constraints tend to function as the dominant bottleneck for investment realization. Demand-side constraints are treated as Φ_demo. 

The definition is summarized in I.3.3, and the operationalization in II.5.3–II.5.5.



III.3 Diagnostic Classification Conditions for the Critical Threshold θ

The “effectiveness” of monetary policy discussed herein is not theoretical partial derivatives or structural marginal effects. Below, the estimated average impulse response to monetary policy shocks is used as the policy effect.

In implementation, Y adopts either the logarithmic level of real GDP or the real growth rate, and the decision rule C_Y(t) is consistently applied to the chosen measure. Specifically,
$$
Y_t \in \left\{\ln(\mathrm{RGDP}_t),\ \Delta \ln(\mathrm{RGDP}_t)\right\}
$$


is selected, and subsequent IRF_Y(h; t) and IRF_Y^{cum}(H; t) are computed based on this choice.

Here, the subscript t does not denote “IRF at time t.” Instead, t represents the endpoint of the sample window used for estimation (labeling the evaluation period). That is, this paper estimates local projections or VAR within an estimation window of length W with fixed endpoint t [t−W+1, t], and denotes the cumulative response obtained as the estimation result as IRF_X^{cum}(H; t). 

The “cumulative response” in this paper is defined using the estimated sequential response IRF_X(h; t) as follows.
$$
IRF_Y^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t)\equiv \sum_{h=0}^{H} IRF_Y(h;t).
$$


(H is the prediction horizon for accumulation, and h=0 represents the current-period response.)

The cumulative reaction for any variable X is denoted as IRF_X^{cum}(H; t). Hereafter, the condition for the growth effect to vanish is defined as follows:
$$
C_Y(t) : \left| IRF_Y^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) \right| < \varepsilon_Y
$$


Empirically, we use IRFs estimated via local projections or VAR models. Hereafter, we denote the average response of real GDP as IRF_Y(h; t), the average response of employment as IRF_N(h; t), the average response of asset prices as IRF_{P^{asset}}(h; t), and the average response of the realized investment ratio as IRF_a (h; t). 

Note that the cost-push coefficient κ introduced in Section III.4 is not a sufficient condition for uniquely identifying the critical threshold θ. Instead, it is positioned as a distance metric that provides supplementary reinforcement to diagnoses based on employment and growth responses.
$$
P_M(t) \equiv \mathbf{1} \!\left[ \left| \mathrm{IRF}_{N}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) \right| > \varepsilon_{N} \;\text{and}\; \mathrm{LCB}_{q} \!\left( \mathrm{IRF}_{N}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) \right) \text{ does not cross } 0 \right]
$$


III.3.1 Branching Rule (Condition → Classification)

The diagnostic tree in III.1.1 can be mechanically mapped using the following condition. Here, δ, ε, τ are used as tolerance bands.

Define the “alternative channel reaction condition” used in Step 3 as \(C_{ALT}(t)\). Let \(𝒥\) (or \(Jset\)) denote the set of series used as alternative channels (e.g., asset prices, foreign investment, retained earnings, M&A, share buybacks, etc., as available), and denote each series as \(X_j\) (\(j \in 𝒥\)). Then
$$
C_{\mathrm{ALT}}(t)\equiv \mathbf{1}\!\left[\exists j\in\mathcal{J}:\ IRF_{X_j}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H;t)>\varepsilon_{X_j}\right]
$$


Here, ε_{X_j} is the tolerance band for each series X_j. Specific series and thresholds are summarized in Section III.3.2.

・R−1 Transmission Mechanism Not Active (Out of scope): P_M(t)=0

・R0 Demand Shortfall / Not Under Diagnosis: C_U(t)=0

・R1 Effective Zone (Φ > θ) candidate: C_Y fails (i.e., growth reaction is not near zero).

・R2 Constraint-consistent (growth invalid/substitute channel active) candidate: C_Y holds and substitute channel reaction conditions hold.

・R3 Transmission mechanism failure/deep constraint (pending) candidate: C_Y holds and substitute channel reaction conditions fail. Branches based on auxiliary conditions (C_TF, C_U, C_κ, etc.) in III.3.3.

・R4 Exogenous Supply Shock Branch: If the Z-dominant condition (e.g., Z's contribution is large in window regression, or contributions from import prices, taxes, or energy are dominant) is satisfied, separate it as an exogenous shock independent of the above.

(※ III.3.2 and III.3.3 consolidate the specific series of alternative channel indicators, asymmetric reaction conditions, applicability conditions, and missing value treatment rules.)



III.3.2 Detailed Conditions (Three-Condition Pattern as Auxiliary Score: Definition, Threshold, Out-of-Scope Rule)

This section does not perform a numerical point estimation of the critical threshold θ. Instead, it formalizes a “set of symptoms consistent with θ (diagnostic signature)” and defines it as an operational decision rule. The three-condition pattern (primary identification and auxiliary diagnosis) articulated in III.1.2 is implemented using the following conditional expressions and thresholds.

Condition 1: Full Employment (or Tight Labor Market) Condition (Auxiliary)
$$
C_U(t):\quad U_t \le U_{\text{natural},t} + \delta
$$


Here, δ is the tolerance band. U_natural uses a proxy for the natural unemployment rate (available estimated series), with the series definition and source specified in the empirical section.

Condition 2: Growth Effect Vanishing Condition (Primary)
$$
C_Y(t):\quad \left| IRF_Y^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) \right| < \varepsilon_Y
$$


 Here, IRF_Y^cum(H; t) denotes the cumulative response of monetary policy shocks based on the estimated window at time t 

(Horizon H). ε_Y is the tolerance band considered “effectively zero”.

Condition 3: Cost-Push Proximity Condition (Auxiliary)

The estimated cost-push coefficient κ̂_t may become unstable in periods with small wage and price fluctuations. Therefore, this paper first imposes an applicability condition that “sufficient variation exists within the window for the estimation to be meaningful”.

(i) Applicability Condition (Fluctuation Requirement) 
$$
A_\kappa(t):\quad \mathrm{sd}\!\left(\Delta w_{t-L+1:t}\right) > \varepsilon_w \ \wedge\ \mathrm{sd}\!\left(\pi_{t-L+1:t}\right) > \varepsilon_\pi
$$


(ii) Cost-Push Proximity Condition
$$
C_{\kappa}(t):\quad \left| \hat{\kappa}_t - \kappa_{\text{ref}} \right| < \tau
$$


Here, κ_ref is not a universal constant but a reference pass-through level that may depend on the country and system. The reference level is operationally defined based on the following reference set.
$$
\mathcal{T}_{\text{ref}} \equiv \left\{t:\ \neg C_Y(t)\ \wedge\ A_{\kappa}(t)\right\}
$$


If the mean is used as the representative value for the reference level, this should be explicitly stated.

Additional applicability conditions based on estimation precision may be imposed as necessary.

If the standard error of the windowed regression is available, windows with high estimation uncertainty may be excluded.
$$
A_{\kappa,\text{se}}(t):\quad \mathrm{se}\!\left(\hat{\kappa}_t\right) < \varepsilon_\kappa
$$


Hereafter, the applicability condition shall generally use A_κ(t), and A*{κ,se}(t) shall be used concurrently as necessary.

Out-of-Scope (N.A.) Rule

For windows failing to satisfy A_κ(t) (and A*{κ,se}(t) if adopted), C_κ(t) is not evaluated and the window is treated as Not Applicable (N.A.). Operationally, cost-push auxiliary diagnostics are not used for θ proximity determination in such windows; instead, the alternative channel condition in Diagnostic Tree Step 2 takes precedence.

Definition of θ Diagnostic Feature (Consolidated Definition in This Paper)

Using the above, we define the θ-neighborhood consistent diagnostic signature metric as follows:
$$
S_{\theta}(t) \equiv \mathbf{1}\!\left[ C_U(t)\ \wedge\ C_Y(t)\ \wedge\ A_{\kappa}(t)\ \wedge\ C_{\kappa}(t) \right]
$$


The following point is crucial here.

- S_θ(t)=1 does not imply a point estimate of θ. It means the observed symptom pair matches a “combination likely to occur in the θ neighborhood.”
- C_U and C_κ are auxiliary diagnostics, not primary identifiers. Specifically, C_κ is evaluated only in windows satisfying A_κ.
- To avoid arbitrariness in thresholds δ, ε*Y, ε*w, ε_π, τ, robustness checks are performed through window changes, alternative series, international comparisons, and consistency with known policy regime switching points.

Supplementary Condition: Asymmetric Response of the Asset Price Channel (Nature of Structural Constraints)

This condition is not a determinant of θ but a supplementary diagnostic that increases the likelihood of “lack of investment outlets (structural constraints)” rather than “funding shortage.”
$$
C_A(t):\quad \left| IRF_a^{\text{cum}}(H; t) \right| < \varepsilon_a \ \wedge\ IRF_{P^{\text{asset}}}^{\text{cum}}(H; t) > \varepsilon_P
$$


III.3.3 Transmission Mechanism Failure and Deep Constraint Regions (Auxiliary Condition) If alternative channels also fail to respond in Step 3, it is necessary to distinguish between (i) transmission mechanism failure due to impaired financial intermediation and (ii) regions with deep structural constraints (Φ ≪ θ). This paper uses financial intermediation indicators rather than outcome variables for auxiliary differentiation.

Auxiliary Condition [Transmission Mechanism Failure]

Auxiliary condition C_TF(t) is defined as a binary indicator representing transmission mechanism impairment. That is:
$$
C_{TF}(t)\equiv \mathbf{1}\!\left[ \text{Spread}_t > \varepsilon_{sp} \ \vee\ \text{Lending}_t < -\varepsilon_{cr} \ \vee\ \text{BankStress}_t > \varepsilon_{bs} \right].
$$


Here, Spread refers to credit spreads, Lending refers to indicators like the lending attitude DI or loan balance growth, and BankStress refers to indicators like bank capital constraints or financial stress indices, using available series.

When C_TF(t) = 1, the period is treated as a “failed transmission mechanism branch” and separated from diagnosis regarding Φ (inference of Φ ≤ θ). Conversely, when C_TF(t) = 0 and C_Y(t) is satisfied in Step 2 (i.e., growth response is near zero), this increases the likelihood of a “deep constraint region (Φ ≪ θ)”.



III.4 Introduction of the Cost-Push Coefficient κ (Clarifying the Operational Definition)

Intuitively, the extent to which wage increases are passed on to prices can be grasped as the ratio of the price increase rate to the wage increase rate. Conceptually, this can be intuitively expressed as
$$
\kappa \approx \frac{\pi}{\Delta w}
$$


 However, this is not a formal definition. Moreover, this ratio becomes unstable when the denominator is small. Therefore, this paper defines the empirical κ as “the slope estimated within a fixed window (the estimated value of pass-through elasticity)”.

Specifically, within an observation window of length L ending at time t, we estimate a regression with the inflation rate as the dependent variable and the nominal wage growth rate as the primary independent variable, controlling for supply shocks, tax factors, etc. The coefficient from this regression is denoted as κ_t.
$$
\pi_\tau = \mu_t + \kappa_t \, \Delta w_\tau + \Gamma_t^{\prime} Z_\tau + \varepsilon_\tau, \quad \tau \in \{ t-L+1, \ldots, t \}
$$


Hereafter, the estimated value of κ_t from the regression within the window {τ = t−L+1, …, t} is denoted as κ̂_t. That is,
$$
\hat{\kappa}_t \equiv \widehat{\kappa_t}.
$$


κ̂_t is used for the Cκ(t) test.

Here, π denotes the inflation rate, Δw denotes the nominal wage growth rate, and Z represents a set of control variables including supply shocks, tax rate changes, import prices, energy, etc. κ_t is a diagnostic indicator representing the “strength of wage-to-price pass-through” within the given window.

By this definition, the observed value (or rank) of κ provides auxiliary information regarding the relative positions of Φ and θ.

- When Φ sufficiently exceeds θ: κ is low (weak pass-through)
- When Φ approaches θ: κ is medium (pass-through tends to strengthen)
- When Φ falls below θ: κ is high (strong pass-through)



III.5 Theoretical Properties of κ and Representative Diagnostic Working Hypotheses

κ is expressed as a monotonically decreasing function of the structural frontier coefficient Φ. Conceptually:
$$
\kappa(\Phi) = 1 - h(\Phi)
$$


Here, h(Φ) is the productivity absorption function, satisfying the following properties:

- When h(Φ) > 0, Φ > θ (wage increases are absorbed by productivity growth)
- When h(Φ) ≈ 0, Φ ≈ θ (absorption capacity disappears)
- lim*{Φ→∞} κ(Φ) = κ*min > 0 (Empirically, κ_min ≪ 1)
- lim {Φ→0} κ(Φ) = κmax

κ is given as a monotonically decreasing function of Φ. For diagnostic purposes, only monotonicity and the behavior at the upper and lower bounds are essential, so it is represented by the following sigmoid-type function.
$$
\kappa(\Phi) = \kappa_{\min} + (\kappa_{\max} - \kappa_{\min}) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \exp\!\left( \eta (\Phi - \theta) \right)}
$$


Here, η > 0 represents the steepness of the transition. The specific numerical levels of κ*min and κ*max may vary depending on institutional conditions such as wage systems, price pass-through practices, industrial composition, and inflation regimes.



III.6 Exception Regimes and Application Limits

III.6.1 Positioning Non-Cost-Push Stagnation

In some economies, particularly Japan, a situation has been observed for an extended period where monetary easing improves employment but leads to little wage or price inflation.

This theory does not interpret this phenomenon as an “exception to the theory.” Rather, it indicates that the economy has transitioned into a regime where the wage formation channel and the cost-push mechanism itself have been structurally disabled, as a result of the demand formation frontier Φ_demo falling significantly below its threshold.



III.6.2 Conditions for κ Applicability

The applicability of κ is determined by A*\kappa(t) (see III.3.2). If A*\kappa(t)=0, κ-related conditions are deemed N.A.

In this case, the following alternative diagnostics are used:

・Asset price sensitivity to monetary easing: ∂P_asset / ∂M

・Scale of foreign capital outflows F_abroad

・Accumulation rate of corporate retained earnings ΔR_retained

These indicators function as alternative signals in the Φ ≪ θ (severe constraint region).

Therefore, “quantitative easing without inflation” is not a phenomenon contrary to this theory, but rather one outcome predicted when the structural frontier reaches a deeper constraint region.



III.7 Third Diagnostic Pillar (Tier 1): θ-Proximity Diagnosis via Quality of Capital Renewal (Absorption into Renewal)

III.7.1 Purpose of This Section (Positioning)

This section formalizes a diagnosis based on “the quality of capital renewal (absorption into renewal/replacement)” as the third diagnostic pillar for identifying the vicinity of the critical threshold θ. The aim is to translate the state of “weak capacity expansion despite ongoing investment” into a form diagnosable solely from the composition of investment and its consistency with capital accounting, without using outcome variables such as growth rates or production volumes.

This pillar operates through a different channel than the retained earnings a diagnosis (diagnosis of fund surplus/allocation) and the cost-push θ diagnosis (diagnosis of supply-side cost pressures). Specifically, by focusing on the “content of investment (absorption into renewal vs. capacity expansion)” rather than the “quantity of investment,” this pillar directly captures the “structure” near θ.



III.7.2 Concept: Absorption into renewal/replacement is a strong indicator near θ

When the structural frontier coefficient Φ approaches the critical level θ, credit supply and investment flows may be maintained in observation. However, much of this tends to be absorbed into maintaining, renewing, or replacing existing capital rather than into capacity expansion (new absorption destinations).

At this point, the following combination often appears in observation:

- Investment (capital investment/gross fixed capital formation) does not significantly decline (“investment exists”)
- However, the increment in capital stock (net increase) and ‘rejuvenation’ are weak (“capacity does not increase/metabolism is weak”)
- As a result, utilization rates (recycling of existing equipment) relatively increase (“existing equipment is overloaded”)

Crucially, the diagnostic tools employed here are (i) investment flows, (ii) depreciation, (iii) capital stock, and (iv) utilization pressure—accounting and operational metrics that can be constructed independently of outcome variables (growth rates, output levels, asset prices, etc.). This ensures Tier 1 diagnostics consistent with the theory's emphasis on “avoiding circular reasoning.”



III.7.3 Operationalization: Diagnostic Indicators Measuring Renewal Absorption (Without Using Result Variables)

Below, we define indicators for “quality of capital renewal” that can be constructed from observable statistics. None directly use result variables such as growth rates, GDP, inflation rates, or stock prices.

(A) Renewal Absorption Ratio

Measures the strength of absorption into renewal/replacement by capturing the ratio of depreciation (depreciation) relative to total investment flows.

- Variables
  - GFCF_t: Gross Fixed Capital Formation
  - CFC_t: Consumption of Fixed Capital (equivalent to depreciation)
- Indicator
  - RAR_t ≡ CFC_t / GFCF_t

Interpretation: A higher RAR_t indicates a state where “much of the investment is absorbed into filling the consumption of fixed capital gap, making it difficult to achieve net capacity increase.”

Note that CF_t (internal fund flow) and CFC_t (consumption of fixed capital) are distinct concepts.

(B) Net Addition Ratio

Measures how much of the investment is purely linked to an increase in the capital stock.

- Variables
  - K_t: Real net capital stock (Net capital stock) or net capital service indicator (where available)
  - ΔK_t: Year-over-year change in net capital stock
- Indicator
  - NAR_t ≡ ΔK_t / GFCF_t

Interpretation: A lower NAR_t indicates “weak accumulation of net capital despite investment” = an overemphasis on replacement absorption (maintenance/substitution).

*If a net capital stock series is unavailable, use the “increase in real gross capital stock” or the growth rate of the capital service index (the “stock side,” not output) as a substitute to construct a similar ratio.

(C) Vintage Rejuvenation Failure Indicator

Directly observes, to the extent possible, the absence of equipment “rejuvenation.”

- Examples (select based on available statistics)
  - Equipment age distribution (average age, median age, quantiles)
  - Age-specific composition of capital stock
  - Capital disposal rate (indicating slow disposal/scrapping, leaving old capital behind)

Interpretation: If the equipment age distribution does not rejuvenate (average age does not decrease/remains high) despite sustained investment, it strongly suggests investment is skewed toward replacement and repair.

(D) Utilization Pressure (Overuse) Indicator

Captures the “load on existing equipment” – a phenomenon more likely to appear when capacity expansion is weak – using metrics like operating rate or capacity utilization.

- Candidate Variables (all reflect “operational state,” not output)
  - Manufacturing capacity utilization, equipment utilization index
  - Capacity utilization
  - Alternatives: Overtime hours, operating time growth (proxies for equipment load)

Interpretation: During periods of strong replacement absorption, capacity expansion is difficult to achieve, while demand/production adjustments tend to manifest as increased utilization of existing equipment. Therefore, rising operational pressure gains diagnostic strength when combined with (A), (B), and (C).



III.7.4 Concurrent Patterns in Tier 1

The rationale for elevating this pillar to Tier 1 lies not in a single indicator but in its ability to suggest θ proximity through “concurrent pattern formation.” The strongest diagnostic proposition takes the following form:

Concurrent Pattern (Tier 1)

1. Investment flow is maintained (GFCF_t does not significantly decline)
2. High replacement absorption (RAR_t remains at a high level)
3. Weak net increase (NAR_t is low)
4. Weak rejuvenation (vintage indicators do not improve)
5. Increased operating pressure (utilization rate/capacity utilization rises)

When points 1 to 5 are simultaneously observed, the state of “investment exists but capacity expansion is weak” can be consistently described in terms of the nature of the investment (replacement absorption) without touching on the outcome variable.



III.7.5 Diagnostic Propositions

Proposition (Diagnosing θ Proximity Based on the Quality of Capital Replacement) Despite a certain level of fixed capital formation (GFCF) being maintained, if (i) the ratio of fixed capital consumption is high, (ii) the increment of net capital stock is weak, (iii) no equipment rejuvenation is observed, and (iv) only operating pressure increases, the economy is likely in a structural phase where investment absorption is skewed toward renewal/replacement and is positioned near the critical threshold θ.

This proposition does not use outcome variables such as growth rates or output. Therefore, it constitutes a Tier 1 diagnosis consistent with the theory's requirement to “avoid circular reasoning.”



III.7.6 Implementation Procedure

Since this pillar is a classification diagnosis rather than a point estimation, it can be described as the following “procedure”:

1. Construct RAR_t from GFCF_t and CFC_t.
2. Construct NAR_t from the net capital stock series (real if possible).
3. If vintage indicators (equipment age, scrapping rate, etc.) are available, use them. Even if unavailable, maintain Tier 1 using combinations of (1), (2), and (4).
4. Acquire the capacity utilization rate or operating rate (or an alternative operating pressure proxy).
5. For period t, confirm the simultaneous occurrence of high RAR_t, low NAR_t, and increased operating pressure, providing a diagnosis near θ.

*The determination of “high/low” can be based on any of the following: (a) deviation from the long-term average, (b) quantiles of the historical distribution (e.g., top 25%/bottom 25%), or (c) quantiles of the international comparative distribution. Crucially, to avoid arbitrary thresholds, declare consistent rules within the paper (since θ is not intended for point estimation, the quantile rule is diagnostically coherent).



III.7.7 Non-overlap with Other Pillars (Channel Separation)

- Internal Reserves a Diagnosis: Primarily examines fund surpluses or stagnation (financial allocation).
- Cost-push θ Diagnosis: Primarily examines cost-side pressures such as prices, wages, and supply constraints.
- This Pillar (Quality of Capital Renewal): Examines structures where real investment is skewed toward “renewal absorption.”

Therefore, even in the same θ vicinity,

- “Funds exist but are not directed toward investment” (financial allocation problem)
- “Investment is distorted by supply cost constraints” (cost constraint problem)
- “Investment exists but is absorbed by renewal” (capital renewal problem)



III.7.8 Limitations and Auxiliary Symptoms (Separation into Tier 2)

While this pillar (Tier 1) is strong for capturing “renewal absorption” itself, it may have the following limitations, which should be explicitly stated in the paper.

- Statistical Constraints: Availability of indicators like net capital stock and equipment age varies across countries. → Countermeasure: Maintain Tier 1 by combining RAR_t and operating pressure, positioning vintage as supplementary where available.

- Sectoral Differences: As digitalization and intangible assetization advance, indicators focused solely on tangible fixed assets may overlook developments. → Response: If intangible investment series (software, R&D, etc.) are available, examine them separately within GFCF breakdowns to distinguish whether “renewal absorption is occurring tangibly or shifting toward intangible investment” (though this remains within the scope of investment breakdowns, not output).

  

III.8 Fourth Diagnostic Pillar (Tier 1 to Tier 2 Boundary): θ Proximity Diagnosis Based on Industrial Structure Rigidity (Redistribution Stagnation)

III.8.1 Purpose of This Section (Positioning)

This section operationalizes “rigidity of industrial structure (weakness of reallocation)” as the fourth diagnostic pillar for identifying the vicinity of the critical threshold θ, formulating it as a diagnostic proposition. This pillar is particularly compatible with the structural variable Φ_inst derived from the institutional environment, strengthening the “structural side” of the theory.

This pillar captures the state where “even if innovation exists locally, the economy as a whole fails to increase ‘seats (absorbers)’ and competition arises,” translating this into observable statistics as stagnation in industrial share redistribution and slowing corporate metabolism. Being closer to medium-term structural movements than short-term cycles (business fluctuations), it is well-suited for θ diagnosis.



III.8.2 Concept: An economy where reallocation stalls struggles to increase investment destinations

When the structural frontier coefficient Φ approaches the critical level θ, even if new products or technologies exist, rigid industrial structures make it difficult for such innovations to manifest as significant market share shifts or market expansion through new entrants. Consequently, innovation tends to remain confined to substitution within existing sectors and firms.

This phenomenon can be described as “weak structural dynamics” without using outcome variables like growth rates:

- Slow/small shifts in industry shares (reallocation)
- Low entry-exit (metabolic turnover)
- Sticky concentration (oligopoly) levels, making rank changes difficult



III.8.3 Operationalization: Diagnostic Indicators for Measuring Rigidity (Without Using Outcome Variables)

(A) Industry Share Reallocation Speed

Measures reallocation speed using the rate of change in shares (ratios) of industry-specific value added, employment, sales, etc. Here, only the change in shares (structural movement) is used, not the “level of the outcome.”

- Variable
  - s_{i,t}: Share of industry i (value-added share, employment share, etc. Use the available series)
- Indicator (Example: Present two; adopt one in the paper)
  - RS_t ≡ (1/2) Σ*i | s*{i,t} − s_{i,t−k} | (Total variation in k-year differences)
  - or, RS_t ≡ Σ*i max(0, s*{i,t} − s_{i,t−k}) (Total amount of share increase)

Interpretation: The lower RS_t, the weaker the structural reallocation of industries (= “seat shifting” is less likely to occur).

(B) Business Entry/Exit Rates and Startup Rates (Business Dynamism)

Using business dynamics statistics to capture the economy's “metabolic rate.”

- Candidate Variables
  - Entry_t: Entry rate (number of new firms / total number of firms, etc.)
  - Exit_t: Exit rate (business closures, bankruptcies, etc.)
  - Startup_t: Startup rate (new business creation)
  - Churn_t ≡ Entry_t + Exit_t (Metabolic rate)

Interpretation: If Churn_t declines and remains low, it suggests an environment where “new seats are hard to come by” due to institutions, practices, regulations, or market structure.

※This indicator is particularly easy to link with Φ_inst (entry regulations, competition policy, labor market institutions, funding systems, etc.).

(C) Concentration Stickiness

This uses the stickiness of concentration levels—where changes in concentration do not occur (rankings become fixed)—rather than the “level” of market concentration (oligopoly degree) being high or low.

- Candidate Variables
  - HHI_t (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
  - CR4_t / CR8_t (Concentration Ratio of Top 4/8 Firms)
- Indicator (Example)
  - CS_t ≡ |HHI_t − HHI_{t−k}| (Smallness of Change)
  - Or, Top-N Turnover Rate (Ranking Change Rate of Top Firms)

Interpretation: The stronger the fixation of concentration or rankings, the less “dynamic” the industry structure. This suggests a structure where even if innovation occurs locally, it is unlikely to lead to overall redistribution.



III.8.4 Treatment as Tier 1–Tier 2 Boundary (Why “Strong but Boundary”)

The main pillar is strong, but the reason it is not fixed as Tier 1 is as follows.

- Small share changes can be influenced by statistical classification granularity, measurement errors, and the presence of exogenous shocks.
- Entry-exit rates and concentration levels vary depending on the readiness of international comparisons.
- Rigidity is not necessarily bad; stable structures can be observed in mature markets (making it difficult to be a decisive factor alone).

Therefore, positioning this pillar as a “boundary pillar” that gains decisiveness when combined with the third pillar (quality of capital renewal) or other Tier 1 pillars (retained earnings a, cost push θ) is the safest and strongest approach for this paper.



III.8.5 Concurrent Patterns (Combinations Maximizing Diagnostic Power)

The strength of θ vicinity diagnosis increases in the following concurrent patterns compared to this pillar alone:

- Low reallocation velocity (RS_t low)
- Low entry-exit (Churn_t low)
- Small changes in concentration/rank shifts (CS_t high stickiness)
- Simultaneously, the third pillar shows “absorption of renewal” (RAR high / NAR low, operational pressure ↑)

This combination consistently supports the narrative that “even if seeds of investment or innovation exist, the industrial structure remains static, preventing the growth of absorption targets, leading to absorption through renewal and replacement”—without requiring outcome variables.



III.8.6 Diagnostic Proposition (Applicable Form)

Proposition (Diagnosis near θ based on industrial structure rigidity) When the speed of sectoral share redistribution remains low, corporate entry/exit rates (metabolic activity) slow down, and concentration levels and top-tier firm rankings exhibit sticky replacement, the economy likely faces stagnant industrial structure redistribution due to institutional and structural factors. Even if innovation exists, it struggles to trigger large-scale share transfers or market expansion, and the growth of investment absorption sources is hindered. This can be interpreted as a sign that the economy is near the critical threshold θ.

This proposition is constructed solely from structural shifts (dynamics of reallocation, metabolism, and concentration), without using outcome variables such as growth rates.



III.8.7 Implementation Procedure (Minimum Set)

1. Prepare industry-specific share series (employment share or value-added share) and calculate RS_t (k=3 years or 5-year differences are practical).
2. Acquire firm dynamics (entry rate, exit rate, start-up rate) and construct Churn_t.
3. If possible, obtain market concentration (HHI, CR4, etc.) and Top-N turnover rate to confirm stickiness.
4. Extract periods where RS_t is low × Churn_t is low × concentration stickiness simultaneously hold, identifying them as reinforcement symptoms near θ (strong boundary pillar).
5. Combine with Pillar 3 (Quality of Capital Renewal) to enhance the accuracy of Tier 1 diagnosis.

III.8.7 Non-overlap with Other Pillars (Channel Separation)

- Retained earnings a: Where funds are stagnating (financial allocation)
- Cost push θ: Cost-side constraints (supply-side pressures)
- Quality of Capital Renewal: Investment flows absorbed into renewal (capital accounting)
- Industrial Structure Rigidity: Halt in share redistribution and metabolism (institutions, competition, market structure)

Therefore, This pillar can serve as an auxiliary mapping of the substance of Φ_inst (competition policy, entry barriers, regulation, corporate governance, labor mobility friction, etc.) as “observable structural motion.”



# **Part IV: Application of Structural Diagnosis**

IV.0 Purpose and Positioning

The purpose of this section is to apply the diagnostic modules designed in Part III (the diagnostic tree and θ-neighborhood signature) to actual observed data, classifying whether the target period is consistent with either the “valid zone (Φ > θ)”, “neighborhood”, or “invalid zone (Φ ≤ θ)”. 

This section provides: (i) the input series required for estimation and determination, (ii) estimation specifications (window length, horizon, identification declaration), (iii) output formats including condition truth tables and diagnostic cards, and (iv) rules for handling missing or unreported data (especially for 2025). Additionally, this section concisely notes the implications (interpretation) and robustness (sensitivity to specifications, thresholds, and series selection) of the obtained classification results within the diagnostic framework.



IV.1 Estimation Protocol (Specification Freeze)

This section constitutes a “specification document” that fixes the estimation method and decision rules in advance to ensure the reproducibility and international comparability of diagnostic results. Subsequent applications (Japan, US, Europe, China, etc.) are executed mechanically under the same specifications.



IV.1.1 Definition of Application Unit and Evaluation Point (t)

This paper defines the evaluation point t as the “year-end quarter (or the latest available quarter)” to perform diagnostics based on window estimation, rather than simple annual comparisons. Specifically, for the years 2015, 2020, and 2025, the evaluation point is, in principle, 2015Q4, 2020Q4, and 2025Q4 (if available). If 2025Q4 is not yet reported, 2025Q3 is adopted as a substitute.

This rule enables provisional estimation within the scope of available quarterly series, even if 2025 lacks complete annual data.



IV.2 Step 0 (Prerequisite: Transmission Mechanism Operational P_M)

Step 0 [Prerequisite]: Is the monetary policy transmission mechanism operational (P_M)?

Confirm whether the cumulative response of employment (or unemployment rate) to a monetary policy shock is significantly different from zero (P_M).

- Employment responds clearly (satisfies P_M): Transmission mechanism is functioning. Proceed to Step 1.
- Employment does not respond (does not satisfy P_M): Treat as “transmission mechanism failure” and exclude from this diagnosis (suspect credit crunch, impaired financial intermediation, etc.).

$$
P_{M}^{U}(t) \equiv \mathbf{1} \!\left[ \mathrm{IRF}_{U}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) < -\varepsilon_{U} \;\wedge\; \mathrm{UCB}_{q} \!\left( \mathrm{IRF}_{U}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) \right) < 0 \right].
$$



IV.2.1 Step 1 (Identification Condition: Near Full Employment C_U)

Step 1 [Identification Condition]: Is full employment (or near full employment) achieved (C_U)?

Check whether the unemployment rate U_t is near the natural rate of unemployment proxy (U_natural,t).

- Full employment is achieved (satisfies C_U): The aggregate demand deficiency regime is excluded. Proceed to Step 2.
- Full employment is not achieved (does not satisfy C_U): Classify as “Aggregate Demand Deficiency Regime (R0)” and exclude from structural constraint diagnosis.

Determination Rule (Fixed)

- Determination: If U_t ≤ U_natural,t + δ, then C_U(t)=1

$$
C_U(t)\equiv \mathbf{1}\!\left[U_t \le U_{\mathrm{natural},t}+\delta\right].
$$



IV.2.2 Step 2 (Primary Symptom: Growth Channel Determination C_Y)

Step 2 [Primary Symptom]: Is the growth channel active? (C_Y)

Determine whether the cumulative response of real activity (e.g., real GDP) to monetary policy shocks is near zero. The estimation method employs either Local Projection (LP) or VAR and is fixed as the specification (LP is the standard in this paper).

Judgment Rule (Fixed)

- Estimation Target: Real GDP (quarterly, seasonally adjusted)
- Cumulative Horizon: H (quarterly)
- Determination: If the absolute value of the cumulative IRF is below the tolerance band ε_Y, then C_Y(t)=1 (growth effect vanishes); otherwise, C_Y(t)=0

$$
C_Y(t) \equiv \mathbf{1}\!\left[\left|IRF_Y^{\mathrm{cum}}(H;t)\right|<\varepsilon_Y\right].
$$



Note: The monetary policy shock series uses a pre-fixed exogenous shock series. The origin, construction method, and aggregation method (quarterly conversion rules) of the series are specified in the series dictionary (IV.7 / Data appendix). (Details of the identification strategy follow the provisions in Part III.)

- If C_Y(t)=0: The period is likely consistent with the “valid zone (Φ>θ)” (R1 candidate). Step 3 is not required.
- If C_Y(t)=1: The period is likely consistent with the “invalid zone (Φ≤θ)”. Proceed to Step 3.



IV.3 Step 3 (Confirming Escape Routes: Alternative Channel Test C_ALT)

Step 3 [Escape Route]: Is the Alternative Channel Active (C_ALT)?

If C_Y(t)=1 in Step 2, inspect whether capital spillovers flowed toward alternative channels rather than the real economy. The alternative channel set 𝒥 is fixed in advance. For each series, estimate the cumulative IRF using the same shock, same window, and same horizon.

Determination Rule (Fixed)

- Alternative Channel Set 𝒥: Adopt the minimum set implementable by country from the following:
  1. Stock Prices (Broad Stock Price Index)
  2. Housing Prices (Housing Price Index)
  3. External Flows (Net Capital Flows or Foreign Securities Investment)
  4. Corporate Fund Retention (Proxy for Retained Earnings/Cash Holdings)
- Determination: If any element in the set shows a “statistically significant positive reaction,” C_ALT (t)=1

$$
C_{\mathrm{ALT}}(t) \equiv \mathbf{1} \!\left[ \exists\, j \in \mathcal{J} :\; \mathrm{IRF}_{X_j}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) > \varepsilon_{X_j} \;\wedge\; \mathrm{LCB}_{q} \!\left( \mathrm{IRF}_{X_j}^{\mathrm{cum}}(H; t) \right) > 0 \right]
$$



“Materially positive” is defined as the point estimate of the cumulative IRF being positive and the lower bound of the confidence interval (at a pre-specified confidence level) exceeding 0 (the confidence level is treated as a fixed hyperparameter).



IV.4 Step 4 (Auxiliary Condition): θ-Neighborhood Signature (Assuming C_U; A_κ, C_κ, S_θ)

Step 4 [Auxiliary Condition]: Near θ or Deeper Constraint (S_θ)

This section uses estimates and stability of labor market tightness (C_U) and the cost-push coefficient κ (A_κ, C_κ) to provide an auxiliary judgment on consistency with the θ neighborhood. The definition of S*θ aligns with Part III and is fixed to include A_κ.

A_κ (Applicability of κ estimation)

- Determined by whether sufficient variation exists in the inflation rate π and wage growth rate Δw
- Judgment: If both series meet the minimum variation threshold, A_κ(t)=1; if not, A_κ(t)=0 (in this case, κ is out of scope)

C_κ (Deviation of κ from Reference Point)

- Estimate κ̂_t via windowed regression
- κ*ref is composed of the reference set 𝒯*ref (typically “periods where C_Y(t)=0 and A_κ(t)=1”)
- Determination: If |κ̂_t − κ*ref| < τ, then C_κ(t)=1

$$
C_\kappa(t)\equiv \mathbf{1}\!\left[\left|\hat{\kappa}_t-\kappa_{\mathrm{ref}}\right|<\tau\right].
$$



S_θ (Integrated Signature)
$$
S_\theta(t)\equiv \mathbf{1}\!\left[C_U(t)\wedge C_Y(t)\wedge A_\kappa(t)\wedge C_\kappa(t)\right].
$$


Note: If A_κ(t)=0, report C_κ and S_θ as N.A. (no imputation).



IV.5 Regime Classification (R1–R4: Mechanical Mapping)

This paper returns the classification labels R1–R4 as the final output of the diagnostic tree. The mapping rules are fixed as follows:

・R0 (Insufficient Demand/Not Diagnosed): C_U(t)=0

・R1 (Candidate for Effective Range): C_Y(t)=0

・R2 (Growth Invalid/Alternative Channel Valid): C_Y(t)=1 and C_ALT(t)=1

・R3 (Growth Invalid/Alternative Channel Unknown/Weak): C_Y(t)=1 and C_ALT(t)=0

・R4 (Exogenous Shock Branch): When the exogenous shock indicator Z identifies a year as “separate from normal diagnosis”

Concrete examples of Z (highly implementable)

- Separate periods where policy shock identification or IRF interpretation breaks down due to institutional constraints like pandemics, supply disruptions from war, financial crises, etc., via prior declaration. (In this paper's standard operation, 2020 is separated as R4.)

Determination proceeds in the order: R4 (Exogenous Shock) → R0 (C_U=0) → R1 (C_Y=0) → R2 → R3.



IV.6 Pre-fixed Thresholds (Parameter Table Provided to Estimator)

To prevent estimators from arbitrarily adjusting thresholds, this paper presents and fixes key thresholds as a table (initial values are set during implementation, recorded in this table, and fixed as estimation specifications. Furthermore, in the results section of Part IV, we report sensitivity analysis on how classification (R0–R4) and key conditions (C_Y, C_ALT, S_θ) under small changes in the main thresholds, window length, and alternative series selection).

### Fixed hyperparameters (diagnostic module)

| Symbol   | Role                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| W        | Rolling window length (quarters)                        |
| H        | Cumulative IRF horizon (quarters)                       |
| L        | Window length for wage-price regression (quarters)      |
| δ        | Tolerance for tight labor condition (percentage points) |
| ε_Y      | Near-zero tolerance for growth IRF                      |
| ε_π, ε_w | Minimum variation thresholds for A_κ                    |
| τ        | Tolerance band for C_κ                                  |

Initial values are listed in this table and fixed as the estimation specification. Furthermore, in the results section of Part IV, we briefly include, as a robustness check (sensitivity analysis), how stable the classification (R0–R4) and key conditions (C_Y, C_ALT, S_θ) remain when the main thresholds, window length, and alternative series are slightly adjusted.



IV.7 Data Architecture (Series Names, Sources, Transformations)

This section fixes “which series to use, at what frequency, and how to transform them.” This allows you to delegate the work directly to the estimator (collaborator) even if you lack empirical capabilities.



IV.7.1 Essential Series (Directly Linked to Diagnostic Trees)

- Real GDP (Quarterly, Seasonally Adjusted)
- Unemployment rate U (quarterly or monthly, quarterlyized)
- Natural unemployment rate proxy (annual or quarterly)
- Price inflation rate π (CPI, quarterlyized)
- Wage inflation rate Δw (wage index, quarterlyized)
- Monetary policy shock series (for identification)
- Alternative channel series (stock prices, housing, external, corporate capital hoarding implementable ones)
- 

IV.7.2 Pillar 3 (Quality of Capital Renewal) Series

- Fixed Capital Consumption CFC
- Gross Fixed Capital Formation GFCF
- (If possible) Net Capital Stock K (differenced as ΔK)

Definition (Follows Part III. Part IV only addresses measurement implementation.)
$$
RAR_t \equiv \frac{CFC_t}{GFCF_t}.
$$


NAR (ΔK/GFCF) and capacity utilization rate, if possible equipment age/scrap rate as “recommended (if available)”



IV.7.3 Pillar 4 (Industrial Structure Rigidity) Series (Minimum Implementation)

- Entry and exit rates (Business demography)
- Weakness of reallocation (proxy such as industry share replacement)
- Stickiness of concentration (if concentration indicators are available)

Due to strong constraints on the availability of international comparisons for Pillar IV, the standard implementation in this paper presents it as an “auxiliary for countries where data is available only,” explicitly showing missing values as such.



IV.7.4 Data Appendix Template

The following is the “series dictionary” to be appended at the end of the main text or in an appendix. Estimators should format data according to this table.

IV.8 Implementation Procedure (A “Delegable” Procedure Manual Assuming Empirical Verification is Not Possible) 

This section presents a flowchart to enable estimators (collaborators) to mechanically reproduce the process according to headquarters' specifications.



IV.8.1 Input Data Formatting (Process 1)

(1) Standardize all series to quarterly frequency. (2) Convert daily/monthly series to quarterly averages (or end-of-period values) and fix the selection rule. (3) Treat missing values as such; do not arbitrarily impute (however, annual-to-quarterly interpolation for the natural rate of unemployment proxy is permitted, and the interpolation method must be specified).



IV.8.2 Estimation (Step 2: LP/VAR)

(1) For each evaluation point t, extract the most recent W quarters as the estimation window.

(2) Using the same shock series, estimate the cumulative IRF from Step 2 (real GDP) and determine C_Y(t).

(3) For Step 3 (Alternative Channel), estimate the cumulative IRF for each series within the same window and determine C_ALT(t) (only when C_Y(t)=1).

(4) For Step 4 (θ-Proximity Signature), determine A_κ(t) from π and Δw within the window and estimate κ̂_t only when A_κ(t)=1.



IV.8.3 Reference Point Construction (Process 3: κ_ref)

(1) Construct the reference set 𝒯*ref as the “period where C_Y(t)=0 and A_κ(t)=1”. (2) Fix κ_ref as the representative value (e.g., median) of κ̂ in the reference set. (3) If the reference set is empty, report κ determination as out of scope for that country (do not force substitution).



IV.8.4 Output (Step 4: Automatic Generation of Tables and Diagnostic Cards)

The estimator mechanically feeds the estimation results into the following table format to generate the final output (LaTeX table). Place the diagnostic card (short text) in the main text and move detailed tables to the appendix.

Detailed estimation tables (e.g., numerical IRF tables) are moved to the appendix, consolidating the main text into Table 1, the Decision Trace, and the Diagnostic Card.



IV.9 Output Format

IV.9.1 Table 1 (Classification and Diagnostic Condition Truth Table: Core of Main Text)

Table: Regime classification and diagnostic condition truth table

| Period | Regime | P_M  | C_Y  | C_ALT | C_U  | A_κ  | C_κ  | S_θ  | Notes |

IV.9.2 Decision Trace

This section concisely records a summary (decision trace) of the diagnostic procedures applied for each evaluation year. This aims to ensure the reproducibility of estimation results and transparency of the judgment process, adopting the same description format for each year.

- 2015: Initial branching was performed based on the growth channel determination (C_Y) result in Step 2, followed by confirmation of the alternative channel response (C_ALT) in Step 3. Step 4 evaluated the θ neighborhood signature (S*θ) and explicitly stated the applicability condition for κ estimation (A_κ). When A_κ was not satisfied, the κ determination was reported as Not Applicable (N.A.), and the final policy regime classification (Regime) was determined.
- 2020: As this year was dominated by the impact of a large exogenous shock, it was treated independently as the exogenous shock branch (R4) according to the operational rules. However, supplementary diagnostic indicators concerning fund allocation and structural state (e.g., RAR, etc.) were included as reference values for structural information.
- 2025: As annual statistics were not yet finalized, a provisional estimate was made using the latest available quarterly data. This point was explicitly noted as a consideration in interpreting the results.



IV.9.3 Diagnostic Card (Summary Record for Main Text)

Purpose (Revised)

This section presents, for each evaluation period (Period), (i) the classification results of the policy regime (R0–R4), (ii) the truth values of key conditions used for branching decisions, and (iii) interpretive considerations (particularly handling of Not Applicable [N.A.]). 

Format (Template for Main Text)

Diagnostic Card ({Period})

- Regime (R0–R4): {Regime}
- Decision trace (summary): {Describe the actual applied branching path for the period in one line}
- Key conditions:
  - Pass-through condition (P_M): {0 / 1}
  - Growth condition (C_Y): {0 / 1}
  - Alternative channel condition (C_ALT): {0 / 1 / Not evaluated}
  - Labor shortage condition (C_U): {0 / 1}
  - κ Estimation Application Condition (A_κ): {0 / 1}
  - κ Neighborhood Condition (C_κ): {0 / 1 / N.A.}
  - θ Neighborhood Integration Indicator (S_θ): {0 / 1 / N.A.}
- Interpretation note: {Describe in 1–3 sentences the consistency between the implications of this Regime and the observed results}
- N.A. note (Not applicable note): {If N.A. occurs due to A_κ=0, etc., state the reason explicitly. If not applicable, state “Not applicable.”}
- Data / timing note (Data note): {State concisely only if provisional values, quarterly substitutes, exogenous shock treatments, etc., are present.}

Notation rules (Methodological Standardization)

1. Notation Rules for Decision Trace (Summary Record)

The Decision Trace shall record only the actual branches traversed during the period, in a format that explicitly shows the causal sequence. The following are representative examples; use the applicable one.

- R4 (Exogenous Shock) `R4 (Exogenous Shock) → Separated from Normal Diagnosis`
- R0 (Insufficient Demand/Not Diagnosed) `P_M=1 → C_U=0 → R0`
- R1 (Candidate for Effective Zone) `P_M=1 → C_U=1 → C_Y=0 → R1`
- R2 (Growth Invalid/Substitution Valid) `P_M=1 → C_U=1 → C_Y=1 → C_ALT=1 → R2`
- R3 (Growth ineffective/alternative weak/unknown) `P_M=1 → C_U=1 → C_Y=1 → C_ALT=0 → R3`

Furthermore, as stipulated in IV.2, when P_M=0 excludes the condition from diagnosis, record it as `P_M=0 → Transmission mechanism failure (Out of scope)` and set the Regime column to `N.A.` or `Out of scope`.

1. Distinction between “Not Evaluated” and N.A.

- Not Evaluated: Conditions where evaluation is unnecessary due to the logical structure of the regime (e.g., when C_Y=0 and C_ALT is not evaluated).
- N.A. (Not Applicable): Cases where evaluation was attempted but the defined applicability conditions were not met, making evaluation impossible (e.g., when A_κ=0 prevents defining C_κ).

1. Standard Formulation for Interpretation Notes

To unify the style and interpretation criteria across the entire text, use the following standard phrases as the base form for each Regime.

- R0 (Demand Shortfall / Not Applicable) The labor market has not reached the natural rate of unemployment (C_U=0), and the structural constraint diagnosis (identification near or below θ) in this paper is not applicable. This is classified as a standard demand-deficient phase.
- R1 (Candidate Effective Zone) The growth response is not near zero (C_Y=0), indicating the growth channel of monetary policy is likely effective. This period is consistent with the “effective zone (Φ > θ)”.
- R2 (Growth ineffective, substitution effective) While the growth response disappears (C_Y=1), a response is observed in the substitution channel (C_ALT=1). This is consistent with a structure where monetary transmission flows to a channel other than the real economy and is positioned as a candidate on the “ineffective zone (Φ ≤ θ)” side.
- R3 (Growth ineffective, substitution weak/unclear) The growth response disappears (C_Y=1), and the substitution channel response is also unclear (C_ALT=0). This leaves open the possibility of a damaged transmission mechanism or a deep constraint region (Φ ≪ θ), and interpretation should be based on auxiliary conditions (S_θ, etc.).
- R4 (Exogenous Shock) Separated from standard diagnostics (R4) because the prerequisites for shock identification and IRF interpretation are not met due to an exogenous shock. Diagnostic indicators are included only as reference information.

Example (included in main text)

Diagnostic Card (2025)

- Regime (R0–R4): R2
- Decision trace (summary): P_M=1 → C_U=1 → C_Y=1 → C_ALT=1 → R2
- Key conditions:
  - Transmission condition (P_M): 1
  - Growth condition (C_Y): 1
  - Alternative Channel Condition (C_ALT): 1
  - Labor Constraint Condition (C_U): 1
  - κ Estimation Application Condition (A_κ): 0
  - κ Proximity condition (C_κ): N.A.
  - θ Proximity integration index (S_θ): N.A.
- Interpretation note: While the growth response disappears (C_Y=1), a response is observed in the alternative channel (C_ALT=1). This is consistent with a structure where funding flows toward alternative channels rather than the real economy, and is interpreted as a candidate on the “invalid range (Φ ≤ θ)” side.
- N.A. note (Out of Scope Note): Since the κ estimation applicability condition (A_κ) was not met, the κ-related conditions (C_κ, S_θ) are reported as out of scope (N.A.).
- Data / timing note: This is a provisional estimate with the evaluation point set at 2025Q3, as the annual statistics for 2025 are not yet available.



IV.10 Description Method for Results Section

To ensure readability and comparability, this paper reports the diagnostic results for each country and evaluation year using a unified three-paragraph structure.

The diagnostic results for (Period) are as follows.

First, in Step 2 (Growth Channel Determination), the cumulative impulse response function (IRF) of real growth to the monetary policy shock was evaluated. The cumulative IRF was determined to be (near zero / statistically significant non-zero), and the growth effect condition was classified as C_Y = (0 / 1).

Next, in Step 3 (Alternative Channel Determination), we examined the cumulative response in alternative channels such as asset prices, the housing market, foreign investment, and internal financing. As a result, since a response was (observed/not observed) in (channel name), the alternative channel condition was determined as C_ALT = (0 / 1).

Finally, in Step 4 (θ Proximity Signature), assuming the full employment condition (C_U) (already confirmed in Step 1), we assessed S_θ after confirming the applicability condition for κ estimation (A_κ) and the κ proximity condition (C_κ).



# **Part V: Relationship with Existing Theories**

V.0 Positioning of the Framework

The framework positions this theory not as competing with or substituting existing major macroeconomic theories, but as a higher-level framework that organizes the structural preconditions under which the causal mechanisms assumed by each theory can operate.

This theory does not directly address the validity of behavioral assumptions (rational expectations, price rigidity, natural interest rate, etc.). Instead, it provides a diagnostic based on observable reaction patterns and capital flows to classify the target period into one of the following regimes: R0–R4 (demand deficiency, effective zone, growth ineffective and substitution channel effective/growth ineffective and substitution channel weak/unknown/exogenous shock). Therefore, this paper’s comparison is not about “which theory is correct,” but rather about organizing “in which classification (regime) the assumptions of which theory are more likely to be consistent with actual observations.”



V.0.1 Principles of Comparison

This paper does not argue over the internal consistency or empirical validity of each theory.

This theory examines whether the mechanisms each theory assumes—policy transmission, investment formation, and growth spillover—can operate consistently with the diagnostic conditions (P_M, C_U, C_Y, C_ALT, S_θ, etc.).

Existing theories are organized with conditional applicability based on the classification (R0–R4) obtained from the diagnosis.

| Theory               | Primary Focus       | Causal Origin           | Position in This Theory |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Solow                | Steady-state growth | Technology/population   | Established when Φ>θ    |
| Keynes               | Demand deficiency   | Approximation of demand | shock when Φ≤θ          |
| Long-term stagnation | Low interest        | rate r* decline         | Result of Φ decline     |
| NK                   | Policy optimization | Frictions               | Premise of Φ>θ          |



V.0.2 Correspondence Table: Diagnostic Classification and Existing Theories

| Diagnostic Classification | Observed Characteristics                                   | Relationship to Existing Theories (Position in This Theory)  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| R0                        | C_U=0 (Not Full Employment)                                | As demand deficiency, primarily references Keynesian stabilization (fiscal/monetary) |
| R1                        | P_M=1, C_U=1, C_Y=0                                        | As an area where growth channels can operate, NK policy analysis and standard growth theory premises are easily established |
| R2                        | C_U=1, C_Y=1, C_ALT=1                                      | Interpreted as an area where spillover to real growth is weak and spillover to alternative channels (assets, external, retention, etc.) is likely |
| R3                        | C_U=1, C_Y=1, C_ALT=0                                      | Area interpreted under auxiliary conditions, reserving the possibility of weak transmission (financial intermediation) or deep constraints |
| R4                        | Separated from standard diagnosis due to exogenous shocks. | Not subject to comparison with existing theories (reference indicators only). |



V.1 Relationship with the Solow-type Growth Model

The Solow-type growth model is a theory describing how an economy converges to a steady state under a given production function and population growth rate.

This theory addresses the preconditions before such a steady state is established—namely, under what conditions the “structural space where real investment can occur” disappears.

In this sense, this theory does not compete with the Solow model; rather, it is a framework describing the higher-level conditions that define the structural domain (Φ > θ) where the Solow model becomes applicable.



V.2 Relationship with Keynesian Theory/Liquidity Trap

The Keynesian framework, particularly the liquidity trap, explains situations where monetary policy becomes ineffective in the short term due to insufficient demand or financial frictions.

This theory explains why monetary policy loses its growth-creating function not merely “temporarily” but “structurally,” from the perspective of the disappearance of investment targets themselves.

Therefore, within this theory, the liquidity trap is positioned as one of the approximate phenomena observed in the region where Φ ≤ θ.



V.3 Relationship with Summers’ Secular Stagnation Hypothesis

Summers (2014) in his long-term stagnation theory pointed out the possibility of demand deficiency becoming permanent through a decline in the natural interest rate.

This theory does not treat the decline in the natural interest rate as a causal variable; instead, it posits a structure where constraints in the investment absorption mechanism (a decline in Φ) result in a downward pressure on the natural interest rate.

In this respect, the two are not contradictory, but their starting points for causality differ. While the Stagnation Theory describes the phenomenon starting from the resultant variable, this theory positions the underlying structural conditions as the primary factor.



V.4 Relationship with New Keynesian Theory

New Keynesian models are theories that address policy optimization under price rigidity and financial frictions.

This theory focuses on the structural conditions that determine a priori whether such policy optimization is meaningful.

Therefore, New Keynesian policy analysis is effective in the regime where Φ > θ. In the domain where Φ ≤ θ, it is interpreted that the substantive transmission of policy is constrained before optimization can occur.



V.5 Clarifying the Theoretical Hierarchy (Summary)

Based on the above, this theory does not replace existing macroeconomic theories. Rather,

- Solow-type growth theory
- Keynesian theory / Liquidity trap
- Long Stagnation Theory
- New Keynesian Model

as a higher-level framework that systematically organizes under which structural conditions these theories effectively function.

In this sense, this theory is not one that presents “new policy rules,” but rather a structural theory for preemptively diagnosing the applicability of policies and existing theories.



## **Part VI: The Special General Theory of Frontier-Depleted Economies**

VI.0 Positioning of the Main Section (Prelude)

The main section organizes the general conclusions that hold only in economies transitioning to the Φ ≤ θ structural regime, based on the diagnostic results indicated by structural frontier theory.

This theory presents not “which policy is correct,” but conditional general propositions: “which policies can no longer function structurally,” and “which policy spaces remain.”

In this sense, this section is positioned not as an application of general theory, but as a regime-dependent special general theory derived from it., but as a regime-dependent special general theory derived from it.

VI.1 Demand-Constrained Growth Hypothesis: Phase Transition and the Wall of Time

Underpinning this theory is the “Demand-Constrained Growth Hypothesis.” The economy's growth rate g(t) is assumed to be determined by the smaller of two limits:

the limit of technological productivity growth g_T(t)

and the limit of demand capacity g_D(t)

where the smaller of the two (the bottleneck) determines the growth rate.
$$
g(t) = \min \left\{ g_T(t),\, g_D(t) \right\}
$$


Crucially, Say's Law and the theory of subjective value are not conflicting theories; they describe different phases of growth.



VI.1.1 Phase I (Creation and Expansion)

In the phase where new goods, technologies, or markets transition from a state of non-existence (0) to a state of existence (1), the very emergence of supply creates demand, and Say's Law (supply creates its own demand) holds. Here, g_T(t) drives growth.



VI.1.2 Phase II (Saturation/Maturity)

Conversely, when existing goods and services attempt quantitative expansion (from 1 to 100), demand constraints like human time, attention, and income become dominant. Subjective value theory and diminishing marginal utility then govern growth. Here, g_D(t) becomes the bottleneck.

Many modern economies are transitioning into this “expansion phase” during their development process.

Digital spaces (metaverse, AI) appear to be technically infinite frontiers. However, on the demand side, there exists an absolute barrier: the “human time constraint.” The amount of time humans can consume per day is a constant T_limit.

Specifically, if we denote digital usage time for “entertainment consumption” as T_ent, then for simplicity, T_ent ≤ T_limit holds. In societies where the structural frontier has become constrained, T_ent is already consumed close to T_limit. The expansion of new digital services thus approaches a zero-sum competition, vying for “time share” from other services.

In this sense, the effectiveness H(t) of the “recreational digital frontier” can be approximated as:
$$
H(t) \propto T_{\text{limit}} - T_{\text{ent}}(t)
$$


As T_ent(t) converges to T_limit in the mature phase, H(t) approaches zero. This is the mechanism by which Say's Law ceases to function and demand constraints become dominant.



VI.2 Dichotomy of Policy Regimes

This theory suggests that the “policy logic” undergoes a 180-degree shift depending on the state (phase) of the economy.



VI.2.1 Policy Logic in Phase I (Substitutable Period)

“Investment and Efficiency”

If an element is scarce, substitute it by injecting money (monetary easing) and technology (innovation). DX and infrastructure investment directly translate into growth.



VI.2.2 Policy Logic in Phase II (Non-Substitutable/Rigid Period):

“Explicit Allocation Priorities and Structural Contraction” In a phase where substitution elasticity has drastically declined, additional capital investment fails to compensate for factor shortages. At this point, the constraint facing economic agents shifts from “how to achieve efficiency” to a decision problem of allocation priorities: “Under constraints of absolutely scarce factors (time, labor), which activities to maintain and which to reduce or terminate?” The rational adjustment pattern in this state, as indicated by the Leontief production function, is structural contraction: reducing the overall scale of activity to match the supply of the scarcest factor.



VI.3 Economics of Density: Declining Structural Frontier Coefficients

An economy facing horizontal limits (quantitative limits) in time resources inevitably shifts course toward “vertical growth.” This aims for “increased density”—enhancing value per unit time (unit price or satisfaction) rather than extending time itself.

At first glance, digital applications that enhance “quality of life and efficiency” in healthcare, education, logistics, etc., seem to offer infinite growth potential by creating value while saving time. However, a new constraint emerges here: the “trade-off between efficiency and utility.”



VI.3.1 The Efficiency Paradox

Technological innovation can compress “means-oriented time” (household chores, commuting). Yet, as humans become wealthier, they increasingly allocate this saved time toward “higher-quality experiences” (self-fulfilling time).



VI.3.2 The Cost of Quality and the Decline in the Structural Frontier Coefficient

Providing “higher-quality experiences” requires advanced technological intervention incomparable to simple mass production. Enhancing “density”—doubling resolution, enabling instant delivery, or providing individually optimized education—demands exponential technological investment and resources.

This structural transformation causes the “decline in the structural frontier coefficient Φ,” a consequence of this theory.

Compared to “quantitative expansion” that merely expands untapped territory (from 0 to 1), “density enhancement” (purifying from 1 to 100) that improves the quality of existing time yields structurally smaller growth margins relative to input costs.

Consequently, the very movement toward “quality improvement” to circumvent demand constraints (the time barrier) increases the difficulty of growth and forces the economic growth curve to become extremely flat. Low growth at Φ ≤ θ is not stagnation but an inevitable consequence of transitioning to a high-cost “high-density society.”



VI.4 The Problem of Defining “Quality” and Its Immeasurability

VI.4.1 Abandoning the Definition of “Quality”

This theory does not provide a strict mathematical definition for “qualitative improvement in demand (increased density)” in an economy where Φ ≤ θ. This is because concepts like ‘satisfaction’ or “richness of digital experiences,” which depend on human sensibilities and subjectivity, cannot be uniformly described using objective units (such as currency or physical quantities).

The “quality” addressed in Φ_demo in this paper does not refer to a concept denoting the subjectivity of value judgments. Instead, it signifies an actual condition that acts as a constraint, albeit one lacking a measurable unit.



VI.4.2 The Wall of Immeasurability

The decline of Φ_demo (the Demand Formation Frontier) does not occur because people cease seeking “better things.”

It arises because “qualitative improvements have entered a realm no longer governed by price mechanisms (indefinable), making them impossible to calculate as investment returns.”

Quantitative Expansion Phase (0→1): “Refrigerators reaching homes without them” = Clearly measurable value to anyone. Investing guarantees profit.

Qualitative Deepening Phase (1→100): “4K video becomes 8K,” “AI conversation becomes slightly more natural” = Value is subjective and ambiguous (undefined). In the digital space, this “ambiguous qualitative improvement” incurs enormous costs, yet no one can calculate “how much price increase” it justifies.



VI.4.3 Investment Restraint Due to Uncertainty

What cannot be defined cannot have its risk calculated.

Therefore, the “frontier of quality” in Φ_demo is closed off not only by physical limits but also by the “unknowability of value (not knowing what constitutes value).”

Even when monetary policy floods the market with money, investors can invest in “measurable quantitative expansion (overseas or asset bubbles),” but they cannot invest in “unmeasurable qualitative deepening (domestic quality of life)” because the returns are invisible.



VI.5 The Investment Trap and Asymmetry in Monetary Policy

One central implication of this theory is that the effects of monetary policy are inherently asymmetric, depending on the state of the economy.

First, during crisis phases (the transition from negative 1 to zero), monetary policy plays a crucial stabilizing role. In situations of credit contraction or liquidity crunch, central bank funding is indispensable for preventing financial system collapse and maintaining settlement and credit mechanisms. At this stage, monetary policy possesses a certain degree of effectiveness regardless of the level of the structural frontier coefficient Φ.

Conversely, during the growth-generating phase in normal times (the phase from zero to positive one), the effectiveness of monetary policy strongly depends on the level of the structural frontier. In economies where Φ exceeds the threshold θ, additional credit supply can be channeled into real investment and potentially induce new growth. However, in economies where Φ ≤ θ, monetary easing loses its growth-generating function.

Particularly when Φ is sufficiently low, the supplied money fails to find domestic real investment outlets and manifests in the following forms:

・Rising prices of existing assets (asset bubbles) ・Capital outflows abroad ・Increased internal reserves in the corporate sector

This state can be formally organized as the following relationship:

The credit supply ΔM received by firms is allocated as follows:
$$
\Delta M = I_{\text{real}} + Q_{\text{asset}} + F_{\text{abroad}} + R_{\text{retained}}
$$


Where:

- I_real: Domestic real investment
- Q_asset: Domestic financial asset purchases (stocks, bonds, etc.)
- F_abroad: Capital outflows
- R_retained: Holding as cash and deposits

In the limit where Φ ≤ θ, I_real → 0. Monetary policy does not “fail to work”; rather, it acts in a way that does not generate growth.

This is the definition of the “investment trap” in this theory and the core of monetary policy asymmetry.

Below, we detail the structural mechanism generating this investment trap from the perspective of the divergence between the accounting definition of investment and its economic substance.



VI.5.1 Divergence Between Accounting Definition and Economic Substance

To avoid circular reasoning, “investment” in this theory is operationally defined as Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in national accounts.

【Operational Definition of “Investment” in This Paper】:

To avoid circular reasoning, this theory defines investment using the following accounting criteria:

Real Investment I_real ≡ Expenditures within additional credit supply that are recorded as Gross Fixed Capital Formation in national economic accounts

Specifically:

- Tangible fixed assets (machinery, IT equipment, buildings, infrastructure) 
- Intellectual property products (software, databases, R&D expenditures)

The following are excluded from the definition of investment:

- Purchase of financial assets (stocks, bonds, foreign currency, crypto assets)
- Transfer of ownership of existing assets (used housing, M&A, land sales)
- Inventory investment (outside the scope of this theory)

This definition constitutes a statistically observable value independent of Φ or policy effects, serving as the basis for calculating the realized investment ratio a = I_real / ΔM.

However, even if accounting-wise identical as “investment,” its economic substance qualitatively differs depending on the structural frontier regime.

[Economic Substance of Investment: Reclassification Based on Frontier Absorptive Capacity]

Even if accounting-wise identical as “capital investment,” its economic substance diverges as follows depending on the structural frontier regime:

■ Phase Φ > θ: Genuine Investment Additional capital stock creates new production capacity and demand absorption power. Example: Post-war factory construction in Japan, infrastructure investment in emerging economies

■ Phase Φ ≤ θ: Pseudo-investment Accounting-based “investment” that does not generate growth for the following reasons:

(a) Defensive investment: Excess capacity to maintain existing market share ・Must invest if competitors invest ・Leads to industry-wide accumulation of excess capital ・Typical example: Proliferation of commercial facilities amid population decline

(b) Substitutive investment: Labor-saving/efficiency gains without demand creation ・Improves productivity but leaves aggregate demand unchanged ・Typical example: AI/robot adoption (only reduces employment)

(c) Exit-preparation investment: Optimization for a shrinking equilibrium

・Typical example: Investment in systems for unmanned stores or reduced delivery areas

These are recorded as I_real in accounting, but macroeconomically they are “competitive defense expenditures” that do not contribute to expanding aggregate demand.



VI.5.2 Two-stage Speculation Mechanism

In an economy where Φ ≤ θ, a double speculation occurs in capital allocation.

【Stage 1: Corporate Capital Allocation Decisions and Φ Dependency】

The credit supply ΔM received by firms is allocated as follows:
$$
\Delta M = I_{\text{real}} + I_{\text{financial}} + R_{\text{retained}}
$$


I_real: Real investment

I_financial: Purchase of financial assets (including stock buybacks)

R_retained: Holding as cash/deposits

Corporate allocation decisions are determined by comparing the expected rates of return for each option:

- r_real(Φ): Expected rate of return on real investment (strongly dependent on Φ)
- r_financial: Expected rate of return on financial assets (weakly dependent on Φ)
- r_retained ≈ 0: Rate of return on cash holdings

Crucially, when Φ ≤ θ:
$$
r_{\text{real}}(\Phi) < r_{\text{financial}}
$$


Therefore, rational firms suppress I_real and prefer I_financial or R_retained.

Furthermore, even when making real investment, the content tends to be biased toward defensive and substitute investments (see VI.5.1) rather than genuine investment.

【Stage 2: Investor Firm Selection and Frontier Avoidance】

Not only is real investment suppressed at the firm level, but speculation also arises at the stage of investor firm selection.

In an economy where Φ ≤ θ, investors prefer mature companies offering stable dividends in existing markets over venture companies pioneering new frontiers (see VI.5.3 for details).

Consequently, funds supplied by monetary easing are diverted away from real investment through the following two-stage filter:

[Stage 1] Investor → Venture avoidance/Mature firm preference → Firm [Stage 2] Firm → Real investment avoidance/Financial asset preference → Non-real allocation

As a result, the macro-observed realized investment ratio a = I_real / ΔM structurally declines.



VI.5.3 Structural Difficulties in Venture Investment

[The Paradox of Venture Investment under Φ ≤ θ]

By definition, venture firms are “pioneers of new frontiers.” However, under the macroeconomic condition Φ ≤ θ, the following structural contradictions arise:

Contradiction 1: Divergence between Supply-Side Technological Growth and Macroeconomic Constraints

“Supply-side technological growth” driven by venture firms certainly exists. New technologies, services, and business models emerge daily. 

However, if the “demand formation frontier (Φ_demo)” that absorbs them is structurally depleted, the following consequences become inevitable:

Typical Example 1: Limits of Disposable Time Even if an excellent AI service is developed, a user's day remains fixed at 24 hours. New services become a zero-sum game, competing for time share from existing services.

Example 2: Chain of Substitution Inventing a new device merely shrinks the market for existing devices. The total demand (Φ_demo) for the entire industry does not expand.

Consequently, investments that are “innovative” at the individual company level ultimately amount to “redistribution within existing markets” at the macroeconomic level.

Contradiction 2: Asymmetric Increase in Uncertainty

The structural frontier regime qualitatively changes the risk-return structure of venture investment:

Phase Φ > θ: Success expands the market itself (expanding the pie) → Failure risk < Expected success

Phase Φ ≤ θ: Even if successful, the market does not expand; it becomes a zero-sum game (pie-grabbing) with existing players → Failure risk ≥ Expected success (plus retaliation risk from existing giants)

Under rational expectation formation, investors compare:

Option A: Venture Investment

- High uncertainty
- Even if successful, the market is limited (constrained by Φ_demo)
- Risk of competition with existing players

Option B: Investment in mature companies

- Low uncertainty
- Stable dividends
- Ability to defend existing market share

When Φ ≤ θ, rational investors prefer Option B.

【The Innovation Paradox】

These two contradictions lead to the following paradox when Φ ≤ θ:

Growth capacity exists on the supply side: Technology, talent, and capital are present, and innovation continues to be created.

Absence of demand-side absorption capacity: The demand formation frontier (Φ_demo) is constrained, blocking the structural pathway for new technologies to translate into sustained growth.

Rational avoidance of capital allocation: Rational investors are compelled to prefer economically stable existing firms over technologically superior ventures.

Consequently, in an economy where Φ ≤ θ, even if innovation occurs, it fails to connect with large-scale capital allocation and thus does not function as a macroeconomic growth engine.

This is not stagnation in technological progress, but rather a phenomenon where the macro constraint of structural frontier depletion blocks the pathway for converting supply-side innovation capacity into economic growth.



VI.5.4 Structural Consequences of the Investment Trap

The above analysis reveals the structure of the “investment trap” under Φ ≤ θ.

Funds supplied by monetary easing diverge from real investment through the following three-tier filter:

Tier 1: Investor Firm Selection (VI.5.3) Preference for mature firms generating stable dividends in existing markets over ventures pioneering new frontiers

Second Layer: Corporate Capital Allocation (VI.5.2) Preference for purchasing financial assets and retaining earnings over real investment

Third Layer: Qualitative Shift in Real Investment (VI.5.1) Bias toward defensive and substitute investments over genuine investment

Consequently, even if accounting statistics show I_real > 0, the economic reality is that “pseudo-investment with speculative characteristics” becomes dominant, preventing sustainable growth. 

Crucially, this outcome stems not from individual irrationality or information failures, but from each agent acting rationally within a structurally constrained frontier.

Therefore, in an economy where Φ ≤ θ, continuing monetary easing does not solve the “funding shortage” problem. This is because the core issue lies not in the quantity of funds, but in the “structural absence of a real frontier to absorb those funds.”



VI.6 An Empirical Evaluation Example: The Japanese Economy in the 2010s

The theoretical framework outlined above is consistent with phenomena observed in the Japanese economy during the 2010s. During this period, Japan continuously implemented large-scale quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, leading to a significant expansion of the monetary base within a short timeframe.

However, real GDP growth remained largely stagnant at an annual rate of around 1%, with no transition to a sustainable growth trajectory observed. In contrast, the stock market saw rising indices, and both external securities investment and corporate sector internal reserves increased significantly.

These observed facts can be explained not by the scale or continuity of monetary policy itself, but by the structural positioning of the Japanese economy during that period—namely, that Φ was below θ. This is consistent with the theory's prediction that in an economy constrained by its structural frontier, monetary easing leads not to growth through real investment, but to asset price adjustments and capital flight.

Crucially, this is not an assessment labeling specific policy management as a “failure.” The theory demonstrates that under different structural conditions, the same monetary policy can yield qualitatively different outcomes.

In this sense, Japan's experience in the 2010s serves as an example illustrating the limits of monetary policy while also suggesting the need to reconsider the prerequisites for policy choices in an economy where Φ ≤ θ.



VI.7 The Dual Structure of the Frontier: The Divergence Between International and Endogenous

The aggregate structural frontier coefficient Φ defined in Part I must be understood as decomposed into two distinct components.
$$
\Phi = w \Phi_{\text{int}} + (1 - w)\Phi_{\text{dom}}, \quad 0 \le w \le 1
$$


Here, Φ*int represents the international frontier (investment opportunities in global markets), Φ*dom represents the endogenous frontier (investment opportunities dependent on domestic demand), and w is a weight dependent on the economy's openness and industrial structure.



VI.7.1 The International Frontier (Φ_int): A Winner-Take-All Structure

In the modern digital economy dominated by network externalities, only a handful of companies worldwide can secure a position as the standard or platform. For winners, Φ_int is infinite, but for losers, it approaches zero, turning investment into a gamble. Unless a project like Japan's TRON initiative can establish a de facto standard, its frontier potential is lost. Consequently, rational investors avoid domestic projects with low odds of success, causing capital to flow to the winning overseas platform operators.



VI.7.2 Endogenous Frontier (Φ_dom): Physical Constraints of Population and Time

Domestic services, housing, infrastructure, and other areas self-contained within domestic demand. Since the amount of time one person can consume per day is fixed at 24 hours, Φ_dom is proportional to population and disposable time. Under population decline, an essential upper limit exists on the total volume of domestic demand. Consequently, investment targeting domestic demand in a shrinking population economy tends to devolve into a “zero-sum game” over a shrinking pie.



VI.8 Overseas Frontiers and the Structure of Capital Outflows

Capital allocation is determined by frontier efficiency expectations, not patriotism. Generally, if Φ*dom < Φ*int, capital flows overseas. However, this process occurs in two stages.



VI.8.1 Domestic Speculation Stage (Delay Due to Information Asymmetry)

Even when Φ_dom is low and real investment opportunities scarce, domestic capitalists prioritize speculating on domestic asset markets (stocks, real estate, etc.) in the initial phase due to information asymmetry regarding overseas markets. At this stage, ΔM is allocated to rising domestic asset prices (ΔP_asset), preventing large-scale capital outflows and allowing the exchange rate to remain relatively stable.



VI.8.2 Overseas Outflow Stage (Regime Shift via Rational Expectations Formation)

 If Φ_dom fails to recover despite continued monetary easing, capitalists form the rational expectation that “the structural frontier will remain below threshold θ.” This shift in expectations causes the information superiority premium from domestic speculation to be outweighed by the structural return advantage abroad. This regime shift triggers and accelerates the sale of domestic assets and large-scale capital outflows to foreign assets, creating downward pressure on the domestic currency. 



VI.9 Problem Setting (Observed Puzzles)

Recent advanced economies report seemingly contradictory phenomena: despite low unemployment rates and stable employment, people report little sense that life has become easier. Specifically, the following coexist: (i) improvements in the number of employed persons and employment rates, (ii) weak real growth in disposable income (especially for the median income group), and (iii) no increase in subjective satisfaction or perceived financial ease.

This phenomenon implies that improvements in employment do not automatically translate into improved living standards, not only in terms of growth rates but also regarding the practically important outcome variable of “happiness/disposable income perception.”



VI.9.1 Limitations of Existing Explanations (Fragmentation)

Existing explanations tend to be fragmented into factors like “high prices,” “heavy taxes and social insurance premiums,” or “subjective issues.” However, these remain mere lists of fragmented causes and struggle to provide a unified causal structure explaining why, even when conditions approach full employment, the tangible sense of living standards (real disposable income and sense of financial ease) systematically fails to improve.



VI.9.2 Unified Framework via Φ (Inevitable as Residual Employment Channel)

This theory does not treat this divergence as a problem of “policy failure” or “unexplainable subjectivity.” Rather, it positions it as the consequence of a qualitative bias in the transmission path of policy responses when the structural frontier coefficient Φ falls below (or is near) the critical threshold θ.

When Φ becomes a constraint (Φ ≤ θ), adjustments brought about by monetary and demand stimulus tend to manifest primarily as quantitative adjustments in employment (number of employees, employment rate, labor time allocation). On the other hand, the “investment absorption capacity” itself—necessary for sustained expansion of value added and stable growth in real income (improved sense of financial security)—is structurally diminished. Consequently, pathways directly linked to improved living standards weaken.

This relationship can be conceptually expressed as follows, consistent with VI.10 (the dual-channel hypothesis):
$$
\Phi \le \theta \Rightarrow \frac{\partial Y}{\partial M} \approx 0 
$$

$$
\Phi \le \theta \Rightarrow \frac{\partial N}{\partial M} \neq 0
$$



If we denote the variable representing perceived living standards (real disposable income or sense of financial leeway) as W, it naturally follows that in a situation where only the employment channel remains, even if employment improves, the sustained improvement in W is weak.
$$
\Phi \le \theta \Rightarrow \frac{\partial W}{\partial M} \approx 0 \ \ \text{(or weak)}
$$


The crucial point is that this argument does not assert that “employment improves but living conditions deteriorate.” Rather, it provides structural conditions under which employment improvement and living improvement can be statistically and systematically decoupled. That is, the divergence where employment improvement ≠ living improvement is not merely an exception but is positioned as a standard symptom of a regime where Φ becomes a constraint.



VI.9.3 Diagnostic Implication (“Living Standards Don't Improve Even at Full Employment” is a Symptom)

The implication of this section is clear. The phenomenon where living standards fail to improve despite conditions approaching full employment cannot be attributed to policy ineptitude or inexplicable psychology. It can be understood as a structural consequence: the employment channel alone survives while the value-added and real income channels become sluggish.

Therefore, the following “coinciding conditions” observed empirically become auxiliary symptoms suggesting Φ ≤ θ (or its vicinity):

- Quantitative employment indicators (e.g., unemployment rate, employment rate) appear favorable
- Yet median real disposable income, real wages, and perceived living standards (both subjective and objective) fail to grow
- Improvements in employment fail to sufficiently connect to sustained increases in value-added or labor productivity

This does not imply incorporating outcome variables into Φ's definition or proxy indicator construction. The focus here is not on “constructing” Φ observationally, but on positioning these patterns as observable symptoms within a regime diagnosis consistent with Φ.



VI.9.4 Placement within this paper (integration at minimal cost)

Placing this section immediately below VI.10 (Dual Channel Hypothesis) allows its addition at virtually no cost to the existing framework. Specifically, it makes explicit that the structure shown in VI.10—namely, the “slowing of the growth channel” and the “persistence of the employment channel”—can explain the practically and socially significant observational fact of stagnant lived experience (weak sense of disposable income) using the same logic.



VI.10 Problem Setting (Observed Social Phenomena)

In recent years, while statistical descriptions such as “GDP is growing” and “TFP (Total Factor Productivity) is rising” “productivity is improving.” However, a growing disconnect from on-the-ground and household perceptions has been widely observed, leading to a loss of intuitive persuasiveness for these statistics not only among the public but also among policymakers. Crucially, this is not merely a technical issue of statistics being difficult to understand; rather, it represents a simultaneous and widespread loss of credibility—a “loss of authority”—where the presentation of statistics itself is no longer socially trusted.

The question for this section is: Why did distrust in productivity statistics intensify simultaneously across the board after a certain period, rather than remaining confined to the specific circumstances of individual industries?



VI.10.1 Limitations of Existing Explanations (Weakness in Addressing “Why Simultaneously?”)

Existing explanations include: (i) measurement errors, (ii) the blurring of output definitions due to the service economy, and (iii) the difficulty of measuring digital goods, intangible assets, and platform value. While these contain valid elements in themselves, they struggle to provide a unified explanation for the temporal and phasic characteristics of “why distrust became strong, widespread, and simultaneous during this era.”



VI.10.1 Y.3 Φ Framework (The Premise Shifted, Not the Statistics)

This theory does not explain distrust in statistics by starting from “statistical flaws.” Rather, it posits that when the structural frontier coefficient Φ falls below (or is near) the critical threshold θ, the primary form of economic growth structurally shifts from quantitative expansion to qualitative deepening. Consequently, the measurability conditions assumed by statistics weaken.

In the Φ ≤ θ regime, the structural capacity to absorb investment is exhausted. Consequently, growth (or progress in economic activity) is unlikely to manifest as additional quantity (increases in output, capital stock, or supply of standard goods). Instead, improvements lean toward the “qualitative” side. This qualitative deepening refers to improvements possessing characteristics such as the following:

- Output definitions become multidimensional, making reduction to a single metric difficult
- Pricing (valuation at market prices) is difficult, or prices do not sufficiently reflect quality
- Investment returns (expected profits) are difficult to estimate using standard calculations

The issue here is not that statistics suddenly “broke.” Rather, the economy's phase has partially exceeded the conditions of “measurable growth” implicitly assumed by conventional statistics—namely, (i) definable, (ii) priceable, and (iii) return-calculable.

This relationship also re-expresses VI.4 (The Wall of Unmeasurability) as an observable phenomenon. That is, as Φ becomes more restrictive, unmeasurability comes to the fore not as an exceptional error but as a consequence of the structural regime.



VI.10.2 The Mechanism of “Distrust” (Divergence Between Rising Statistical Values and Perceptions of Daily Life/Field Conditions)

For distrust in productivity statistics to emerge as a social phenomenon, it requires not only measurement difficulties but also the overlapping condition that “statistical improvements are perceived as less likely to translate into tangible improvements in the field or household experiences.” This is consistent with VI.10 (the dual-channel hypothesis).

In a Φ ≤ θ scenario, statistically observed improvements (e.g., rising TFP) may not stably translate into tangible improvements in living conditions, such as wages, perceived disposable income, or financial leeway. Consequently, the “increase” indicated by statistics becomes linked to people's experience of “things should be improving but aren't,” surfacing as doubt about the statistics' accuracy itself.

The argument here is not that “the statistics are wrong.” Rather, it is that the social persuasiveness of statistics is undermined because the objects they capture become less aligned (or the alignment weakens) with the value dimensions emphasized by people's lives and the realities on the ground.



VI.10.3 Diagnostic Implications (Formulation as “The Stage Where Measurable Growth Has Ended”)

Based on the above, this section offers the following diagnostic conclusion:

- We have not entered an “era where productivity cannot be measured.”
- As a result of shifting to Φ ≤ θ (or its vicinity), we have entered a stage where “measurable growth” has relatively ended, and the weight of “hard-to-measure progress (qualitative deepening)” has increased.

Therefore, distrust in productivity statistics can intensify simultaneously as a symptom of structural regime shift, not merely as an accumulation of individual factors like digitalization and servitization. This reframes VI.4 (The Wall of Unmeasurability) not as a “theoretical limit” but as a “socially observable mystery,” reinforcing the external validity of this paper's diagnostic framework (its connection to how reality is narrated).



VI.10.4 Placement within this paper

The most natural placement for this section is immediately after VI.4 (The Wall of Unmeasurability), demonstrating that “unmeasurability” is not merely an abstract claim but corresponds to the observable phenomenon of “statistical disempowerment.” Furthermore, linking it to the previous section (Addition ①: Stagnation of Perceived Living Standards under Full Employment) allows the chain “Employment improves but living standards don't” → “Statistical improvements are not trusted” can be described as a coherent pattern.



VI.11 The Difficulty of Government Frontier Creation

VI.11.1 Introduction of the Political Friction Coefficient λ

Below, we introduce political factors as an additional constraint governments face when attempting to create structural frontiers.

Regarding the question of whether the government can artificially create a structural frontier Φ through national projects when the private sector fails to invest sufficiently, this theory posits that while theoretically possible, the attenuation of effects due to political constraints is inevitable during implementation. This attenuation factor is defined here as the political friction coefficient λ.

The effective frontier Φ_eff, accounting for political friction, is formulated as follows:
$$
\Phi_{\text{eff}} = \Phi \times (1 - \lambda)
$$


Here, the political friction coefficient λ is a parameter satisfying
$$
0 \le \lambda \le 1
$$


and represents the “political and bureaucratic risk aversion coefficient.” A larger λ intensifies the avoidance of responsibility for failure and the risk of criticism, thereby suppressing investment in long-term, ambitious national projects.

In peacetime, λ tends to remain elevated due to the accountability structures faced by bureaucrats and politicians—specifically, institutional incentives prioritizing failure avoidance over success-based evaluation, coupled with increased costs of consensus-building. Consequently, government attempts to create new frontiers, while formally existing, often lack substantive impact.

Conversely, under wartime mobilization, under the extreme perception that “defeat equals a crisis of national survival,” political and bureaucratic risk aversion significantly recedes. Observational evidence confirms instances where λ approaches 0. However, this theory does not advocate for war as a policy; it merely cites such instances as observational examples where the political friction coefficient decreased.

The policy challenge this theory presents lies in constructing methods to reduce λ during peacetime through institutional design, without resorting to wartime mobilization or industrial distortions.



VI.11.2 Limitations of Peacetime National Projects: Persistently High λ

In peacetime democratic societies, λ tends to remain persistently high due to the following factors.

The Accountability Trap:

Bureaucrats and politicians fear a single scandal (“1 loss”) more than a record of “10 wins and 1 loss.” Consequently, budgets tend to concentrate on “public works that are certain to succeed but lack innovative elements.”

Consensus-Building Costs:

Policies like decarbonization often face “general agreement but specific opposition,” requiring enormous time for stakeholder coordination. 

This diminishes the speed and scale of investment.

Therefore, as long as democracy and a sound bureaucracy exist, it is structurally difficult to raise Φ_eff = Φ × (1 − λ) to emergency-levels in peacetime national projects. The focus of this paper is not on using war as a means, but on “how such a reduction in λ can be emulated through peacetime institutional design.”



VI.12 Reconstructing Monetary Policy Evaluation

VI.12.1 Problem Statement: Why Does Monetary Easing “Seem to Work but Not Work”?

In economies where Φ ≤ θ, monetary easing is often evaluated as a “failure.” Conversely, some countries observe declining unemployment rates and conditions close to full employment. This apparent contradiction stems from evaluating monetary policy effectiveness using a single growth indicator (GDP). This supplementary discussion theoretically resolves this contradiction by decomposing monetary policy effects into two independent channels. 

VI.12.2 Dual Channel Hypothesis: Employment Channel and Growth Channel

This theory posits that monetary policy affects the economy through the following two pathways:

(1) Employment Adjustment Channel (Real Wage Channel)
$$
\frac{\partial N}{\partial M} \neq 0
$$


Monetary easing lowers real wages through the formation of inflation expectations and nominal wage rigidity. The decline in real wages stimulates labor demand and increases employment by reducing firms' employment costs. This channel functions as a short-term labor market adjustment mechanism.

Crucially, this employment adjustment channel does not depend on the level of the structural frontier coefficient Φ. That is, even in economies with a restrictive investment absorption structure where Φ ≤ θ, monetary easing can still have an employment expansion effect via lower real wages. In this sense, the employment effect of monetary policy “does not become zero.”

However, employment expansion through this channel, if not accompanied by productivity gains or capital accumulation, may lead to a decline in real income per worker and a qualitative deterioration of domestic demand.

(2) Growth Channel (Investment/Frontier Absorption Channel)
$$

For monetary easing to generate sustained economic growth, additional credit supply must be converted into real investment. This growth channel is effective only when the structural frontier coefficient Φ exceeds the threshold θ.

In economies where Φ > θ, real investment opportunities exist, allowing monetary easing to propagate into capital stock expansion, productivity gains, and higher potential growth rates. Conversely, in economies where Φ ≤ θ, real investment opportunities are structurally constrained. Monetary easing fails to generate growth and instead manifests as asset price inflation or capital outflows.



VI.12.3 Mathematical Formulation (Conceptual Expression)

This dual structure can be expressed as follows:

Growth Effect: ∂Y/∂M = 0 (when Φ ≤ θ)

Employment Effect: ∂N/∂M ≠ 0 (effective through real wage adjustment)

That is, in economies where the structural frontier falls below the threshold, the marginal effect of monetary policy on growth disappears, while its marginal effect on employment persists.

 In this theory, improvements in employment do not imply a relaxation of structural constraints. Therefore, using employment indicators to judge an economy's growth regime is theoretically inappropriate. Consequently, the evaluation of monetary policy in this theory must be conducted by clearly separating employment indicators from growth indicators; logically, it is not permissible to integrate the two as identical policy outcomes.



VI.12.4 The Disconnect Between Full Employment and Growth

This dual-channel hypothesis theoretically demonstrates that “achieving full employment” and “economic growth” do not necessarily occur simultaneously. In an economy where Φ ≤ θ, even if monetary easing achieves a state close to full employment, this does not guarantee sustained increases in national income or improvements in living standards.Therefore, while achieving full employment signifies the success of monetary policy, it is erroneous to evaluate this as the success of growth policy. The feasibility of generating growth is ultimately determined by the level of the structural frontier.



VI.12.5 Integration with Frontier TheoryThe dual-channel hypothesis presented in this supplementary discussion complements structural frontier theory. Where frontier theory addresses the question “Why doesn't monetary easing generate growth?”, this supplement provides an additional explanation: “Why, nevertheless, can employment still improve?” In conclusion, monetary policy retains its effectiveness as an employment adjustment policy in economies where Φ ≤ θ, but it possesses an asymmetric character: its role as a growth-generating policy is severely constrained by the structural frontier. Evaluating monetary policy without clarifying this distinction contributes to confusion in contemporary policy debates. Moreover, the reason monetary easing fails to spill over into growth in Φ ≤ θ economies lies in the fact that central bank credit supply is institutionally confined to financial institutions and markets, failing to translate directly into corporate real investment. This theory positions this phenomenon not as non-neutrality due to short-term price and wage frictions, but as a condition of monetary policy ineffectiveness dependent on the structural regime.



VI.13 Two-Sector Model: The Componentization of the Physical by the Digital

VI.13.1 The Structure of Digital TaylorismThe relationship between the digital sector (Sector A) and the physical sector (Sector B) tends to manifest not as coexistence or fusion, but as one of “control and subordination.”When advanced digital technologies are introduced into physical workplaces, they function not as tools to enhance workers' capabilities, but as tools of “digital Taylorism” that minimize and standardize labor processes.This facilitates the emergence of the following phenomena:Deskilling of Labor: Navigation and AI instruction systems eliminate the need for skill. While lowering entry barriers, this reduces labor value to the level of “interchangeable parts.”Attribution of Productivity Gains: The fruits (profits) of efficiency gains accrue entirely to capital (Sector A), which designs and owns the systems, not to frontline workers (Sector B).Wage Decoupling: Even as corporate productivity rises, the real productivity (value added) of frontline labor does not increase, leading to stagnant or declining real wages.

This structure provides a plausible mechanism explaining why “even as technological innovation advances, macro demand Φ_demo fails to recover.” Since workers are also consumers, the commoditization of labor reduces their willingness and ability to consume, forming a self-defeating feedback loop (the investment trap).



VI.13.2 Shifting Policy Implications

Therefore, merely “promoting DX” or “reskilling” will not solve the problem.

The DX Paradox: The more companies individually advance DX, the more labor demand decreases, the remaining labor becomes simplified, and macroeconomic aggregate demand (Φ) shrinks.

Alternative Direction: A system is needed to forcibly redirect the excess profits generated by Sector A (digital leaders) away from market forces toward “areas where value arises from humans spending time as humans (care, culture, community)” (publicly-driven protection and high-value-added transformation of Sector B).



VI.14 Structural Theory of Small-Country High Income

VI.14.1 The Small-Country High Income Paradox: Overcoming Physical Limits

In economies with finite resources and space, the depletion of the domestic investment frontier (physical growth potential Φ_real) is inevitable. Traditional growth theory posits that nations whose frontier is depleted fall into a steady state (low growth).

However, countries like Luxembourg and Singapore maintain extremely high income levels despite having physically minimal domestic frontiers.

This theory defines this not as an exceptional phenomenon, but as theoretically suggested based on rational expectations formation. These countries function not as “final destinations for investment,” but as “structural gateways” connecting to the remaining frontiers in the world. This is not a substitute for physical growth, but rather an institutional node that maximizes the probability of connecting to globally dispersed frontiers.



VI.14.2 Definition of the Expected Permeability Coefficient (P_e)

When economic agents establish a base in a specific nation, their motivation is determined not by the size of the domestic market, but by the probabilistic expectation of “how efficiently and reliably they can access global investment opportunities by transiting through that country.” This is defined as the Expected Permeability Coefficient P_e.
$$
P_e = f(\text{Tax}, \text{NonInt}, \text{Info}) \times (1 - G)
$$
Here, P_e is composed of the following elements:

1. Tax (Tax Incentives): Low rates for corporate tax, financial income tax, and dividend tax. Particularly, the function of a tax haven under specific conditions causes the dispersion of tax expectations to converge rapidly, leading to a nonlinear increase in P_e.
2. NonInt (Guarantee of Political Dynamic Consistency): The degree of trust that the government will not arbitrarily intervene in economic activities (discussed later).
3. Info (Information Transparency): The degree to which information asymmetry is eliminated through the commonality of language and legal systems (e.g., common law).
4. G (Geopolitical Buffer Factor): A discount factor (0 ≤ G < 1) representing the extent to which geopolitical conflicts between nations, security tensions, sanctions risks, etc., diminish the effectiveness of P_e. It indicates whether the predictability of institutionally formed expectations can be maintained even during crises.



VI.14.3 Relative Inequality of Capital Mobility

Whether a firm relocates its headquarters from country A (home country) to country B (hub country) is determined by the following inequality:
$$
P_e(B) - P_e(A) > I_a
$$


- P_e(B) - P_e(A): Relative difference in expected permeability coefficients
- I_a (Information Asymmetry Cost): Uncertainty and search costs associated with overseas relocation

Therefore, under rational expectation formation, firms predict the depletion of their home country A's frontier and future tax burden increases (intervention due to fiscal deterioration). Conversely, the moment Country B's P_e becomes overwhelmingly high, and its benefits outweigh the risk I_a of overseas expansion, capital flows to Country B.

In other words, the prosperity of hub nations structurally depends on the “push pressure” generated by frontier depletion and institutional rigidity (low P_e) in other countries.



VI.14.4 Separating “Freedom” and “Non-Intervention”

One of the greatest contributions of this theory lies in redefining the ‘freedom’ capital seeks.

As a condition for capital accumulation, “political freedom” in the general sense (democracy, freedom of speech) is not essential. What capital values in its rational expectations is “the absence of arbitrary intervention by political power in economic activities (Non-Intervention).”

- The Dilemma of Democracy: In highly free democratic nations, the risk of tax and regulatory changes driven by public opinion (intervention risk) is ever-present, discounting the future expected value of P_e.
- The Non-Intervention Paradox: Even with restricted political freedom, if the government maintains absolute non-intervention regarding “contract enforcement” and “property rights inviolability,” predictability for investors is maximized, and P_e increases.

In rational expectations formation, the invariance of constraints (time consistency) is more important than the level of freedom.



VI.14.5 Digital Taylorism and Structural Consequences

In a world where the structural frontier has been exhausted, the path for nations to maintain high incomes lies in maximizing P_e, concentrating the digital sector (Sector A) within their own borders, and maximizing the economics of density.

At this point, the physical sector (Sector B) is fragmented into components by digital Taylorism and dispersed globally. The fruits of productivity gains are concentrated in the digital sector, which holds design, management, and algorithms, rather than on the shop floor.

Consequently, the nation's high income is achieved not through increased domestic production, but as the accumulation of central functions managing and optimizing globally dispersed physical processes. However, this structure simultaneously endogenously suppresses macro demand Φ_demo through the de-skilling of labor and wage decoupling, creating an “investment trap” for the global economy as a whole.

 

VI.15 Two Paths Left for Economies Where Φ Falls Below the Critical Point

VI.15.1 Path 1: Emergency Mobilization (Non-Recommended Case)

Forcibly reduce λ through war or emergency mobilization, mobilizing demand and investment in a catastrophic manner. This theory does not recommend this path.



VI.15.2 Path 2: Institutional Redesign in the Maturity Phase

Embrace “qualitative growth,” maintain Sector B (the physical sector) through a logic distinct from market principles, and envision a new social contract. Specifically, this requires institutionalizing mechanisms to reduce λ during peacetime, non-market guarantees for maintaining the physical sector, and redistribution systems ensuring distributive fairness. Given the “limitations of conventional policies” revealed by the diagnostic empirical analysis in Part I, exploring this “Path 2” is an urgent priority.



# **Conclusion: Scope and Limitations of the Theory**

Theoretical Contributions:

This theory strictly distinguishes structure (Φ) from outcome (a), avoiding circular reasoning, and presents testable predictions.

 It enables bottleneck diagnosis via min functions and theorizes the asymmetry in the effectiveness of monetary policy during crises versus normal times.

 Some of the structural constraints addressed by this theory, particularly elements like the density of time, attention, and value contained within the demand formation frontier Φ_demo, cannot in principle be reduced to a single quantitative indicator. This paper positions this unmeasurability not as a flaw in the theory, but as an inherent characteristic of the structural problems faced by mature economies.

Limitations and Future Research:

Detailed analysis of Φ's internal structure, its relationship with short-term business cycles, connection to microfoundations, and statistical estimation of alternative elasticities are future research tasks.

Final Thesis:

As an empirical thesis (Parts I–IV) , we conclude that “in economies where the structural frontier coefficient Φ falls below the threshold θ, monetary easing fails to generate real investment, tending to manifest as asset price inflation and capital outflows.” This is econometrically testable.

As a normative claim (Part VI), we propose that “in economies with structurally low Φ, institutional design distinct from conventional policies is necessary to sustain Sector B (the physical sector).” 

This theory provides a new policy perspective by clearly distinguishing diagnostic empirical analysis from normative consideration regarding structural challenges that are universally inherent in all economies and manifest according to their development stage.



Note:

This paper presents a theoretical framework constructed through inductive reasoning based on observed facts, prior to the systematic study of existing macroeconomic theories.Subsequent literature review by the author confirmed that some key conclusions of this theory are independently consistent with multiple existing theoretical concepts, such as the natural interest rate, the marginal rate of investment, and time allocation theory.This suggests that this paper should be positioned as a structural organization based on observed facts, rather than a deductive extension of a specific theoretical system.
