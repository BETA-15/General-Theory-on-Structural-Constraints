IV.1.4 Step 3 (θ-Neighborhood Signature: C_U, Aκ, Cκ, S_θ)
This section uses the stability of labor market tightness and cost-push coefficients to perform an auxiliary check on consistency with the θ neighborhood. The definition of Sθ is aligned with Part III and fixed to include Aκ (to eliminate definition inconsistencies).
C_U (Tightness)
Uses the unemployment rate U_t and a natural unemployment rate proxy (U_natural)
Determination: If U_t ≤ U_natural + δ, then C_U(t)=1
$$
\begin{equation} C_U(t)\equiv 1\left[U_t \le U_{\mathrm{natural},t}+\delta\right]. \end{equation}
$$

A_κ (Applicability of κ estimation)
Determined by whether sufficient volatility exists in the inflation rate π and wage growth rate Δw (e.g., within-window variance, range)
Determination: If both series meet the minimum volatility threshold, Aκ(t)=1; otherwise, Aκ(t)=0 (in this case, κ is out of scope)
C_κ (Deviation of κ from Reference Point)
Estimate κ̂_t via window regression
κref is composed of the reference set 𝒯ref (typically “periods where C_Y(t)=0 and A_κ(t)=1”)
Determination: If |κ̂t − κref| < τ, then C_κ(t)=1
$$
\begin{equation} C_\kappa(t)\equiv 1\left[\left|\hat{\kappa}_t-\kappa_{\mathrm{ref}}\right|<\tau\right]. \end{equation}
$$

S_θ (Integrated Signature)
Definition is fixed to include A_κ
$$
\begin{equation} S_\theta(t)\equiv 1\left[C_U(t)\wedge C_Y(t)\wedge A_\kappa(t)\wedge C_\kappa(t)\right]. \end{equation}
$$

IV.1.5 Regime Classification (R1–R4: Mechanical Mapping)
This paper returns the classification labels R1–R4 as the final output of the diagnostic tree. The mapping rules are fixed as follows.
R1 (Candidate Valid Range): C_Y (t)=0
R2 (Growth Invalid/Alternative Channel Valid): C_Y(t)=1 and C_ALT(t)=1
R3 (Growth Invalid/Alternative Channel Unclear/Weak): C_Y(t)=1 and C_ALT(t)=0
R4 (Exogenous Shock Branch): When the exogenous shock indicator Z identifies the year as “separated from normal diagnosis”
Examples of Z (highly implementable ones)
Separate situations where policy shock identification or IRF interpretation breaks down—such as institutional restrictions during pandemics, supply disruptions due to war, or financial crises—by pre-declaring them. (In this paper's standard operation, 2020 is separated as R4.)
IV.1.6 Pre-fixed Thresholds (Parameter Table for Estimators)
To prevent estimators from arbitrarily adjusting thresholds, this paper presents key thresholds as a fixed table (initial values are set during implementation; sensitivity analysis is reported in Part V).
Fixed hyperparameters (diagnostic module)
Symbol Role
W Rolling window length (quarters)
H Cumulative IRF horizon (quarters)
L Window length for wage-price regression (quarters)
δ Tolerance for tight labor condition (percentage points)
ε_Y Near-zero tolerance for growth IRF
επ, εw Minimum variation thresholds for A_κ
τ Tolerance band for C_κ
(This table is to be filled in as an operational declaration. Even if values cannot be filled in, the IV framework remains valid as long as the specifications are fixed.)
IV.2 Data Design (Data Architecture: Series Names, Sources, Transformations)
This section fixes “which series to use, at what frequency, and how to transform them.” This allows you to delegate the work directly to the estimator (collaborator) even if you lack empirical capabilities.
IV.2.1 Essential Series (Directly Linked to Diagnostic Tree)
Real GDP (Quarterly, Seasonally Adjusted)
Unemployment Rate U (Quarterly or Monthly, Quarterlyized)
Natural Rate of Unemployment proxy (Annual or Quarterly)
Price inflation rate π (CPI, quarterly)
Wage inflation rate Δw (wage index, quarterly)
Monetary policy shock series (for identification)
Alternative channel series (stock prices, housing, external, corporate capital hoarding - implementable ones)
IV.2.2 Third Pillar (Quality of Capital Renewal) Series
Fixed capital consumption CFC
Gross fixed capital formation GFCF
(If possible) Net capital stock K (difference ΔK)
Definitions (Follow Part III. Part IV deals only with measurement implementation.)
$$
\begin{equation} RAR_t \equiv \frac{CFC_t}{GFCF_t}. \end{equation}
$$

IV.2.3 Pillar 4 (Industrial Structure Rigidity) Series 
(Minimal Implementation) 
Entry and Exit Rates (Business Demography)
Weakness of Redistribution (Proxy such as Industry Share Shifts)
Sticky Concentration (If concentration indicators are available)
Due to strong constraints on international comparability for Pillar IV, the standard implementation in this paper presents it as an “auxiliary for countries where data is available only,” explicitly showing missing values as such.
IV.2.4 Data Appendix Template (for insertion into the paper)
The following is the “series dictionary” to be inserted at the end of the main text or in an appendix. Estimators should format data according to this table.
Table: Data appendix – series list and transformations
Block Series Freq. Transform Notes
Step1 Real GDP Q log level or growth for LP/VAR dependent variable
Step3 Unemployment U M/Q level (%) quarterly average if monthly
Step3 Natural rate proxy A/Q level (%) interpolate if annual
Step3 CPI inflation π M/Q yoy or qoq annualized fixed definition across countries
Step3 Wage growth Δw M/Q yoy wage index preferred
Shock Monetary policy shock event / M / Q aggregated to Q identification source must be cited
Step2 Asset price index D/M/Q log change or return cumulative IRF
Step2 Housing price index M/Q log change cumulative IRF
Step2 Net foreign flow Q ratio or level depends on availability
Pillar3 CFC, GFCF A/Q ratio (RAR) national accounts preferred
Pillar4 Entry / Exit, etc. A rates optional (availability-limited)
IV.3 Implementation Procedure (A “delegable” procedure manual assuming no empirical verification)
This section presents the procedure as a workflow chart so the estimator (collaborator) can proceed directly. You should attach this section to your “Research Collaboration Request”.
IV.3.1 Input Data Formatting (Process 1)
(1) Standardize all series to quarterly frequency.
 (2) Unify daily/monthly series to quarterly averages (or end-of-period values) and fix the selection rule.
 (3) Treat missing values as missing; do not arbitrarily impute (however, annual→quarterly interpolation for the natural rate of unemployment proxy is permitted; specify the interpolation method).
IV.3.2 Estimation (Step 2: LP/VAR)
(1) For each evaluation point t, extract the most recent W quarters as the estimation window.
(2) Using the same shock series, estimate the cumulative IRF for Step 1 (Real GDP) and determine C_Y(t).
(3) For Step 2 (Alternative Channel), estimate the cumulative IRF for each series within the same window and determine C_ALT(t).
 
(4) For Step 3 (κ), determine Aκ(t) from π and Δw within the window, and estimate κ̂_t only when Aκ(t)=1.
IV.3.3 Reference Point Construction (Process 3: κ_ref)
(1) Construct the reference set 𝒯ref as the “period where C_Y(t)=0 and Aκ(t)=1”.
(2) Fix κ_ref as the representative value (e.g., median) of κ̂ in the reference set.
 (3) If the reference set is empty, report κ determination as out of scope for that country (Do not force substitution).
IV.3.4 Output (Step 4: Automatic Generation of Tables and Diagnostic Cards)
The estimator mechanically feeds the estimation results into the following table format to generate the final output (LaTeX table). Diagnostic cards (short statements) are placed in the main text, while detailed tables are moved to the appendix.

2015: Branching based on Step1 result (C_Y). Confirm Step2 result (C_ALT). Step3 (Sθ) explicitly states applicability of Aκ; if outside scope, report as such. Ultimately determine Regime.
2020: Separated as exogenous shock branch (R4) (operational rule). However, auxiliary pillars (RAR, etc.) are included as structural information.
2025: If annual data is not yet confirmed, use the latest quarterly data for a provisional estimate and note this accordingly.
IV.5 Writing the Results Section (Diagnostic Card: Text Template to Paste into the Main Text)
For each country × each year, always standardize using the following three paragraphs (do not write differently). This ensures “you won't get tired of writing.”
Template (paste as-is, replace only text in brackets)
The results for (Period) are as follows. In Step1 growth channel determination, the cumulative IRF was (near zero/non-zero), resulting in C_Y=(0/1).
 
In Step 2's Alternative Channel, cumulative reactions were observed in (stock prices/housing/external/internal funds), resulting in C_ALT=(0/1).
 In Step 3's Neighborhood Signature, C_U=(0/1) , Aκ=(0/1) (when Aκ=0, κ determination is reported as out of scope), resulting in Cκ=(0/1/N.A.) and Sθ=(0/1/N.A.). Therefore, the Regime is classified as (R1/R2/R3/R4).

IV.5 Diagnostic Card (for main text insertion: U.S.)
(2015)
 
The 2015 results are as follows. In Step 1 growth channel determination, the cumulative IRF was (N.A.), resulting in C_Y=N.A. 
 In Step 2 alternative channels, cumulative response was observed for (N.A.), resulting in C_ALT=N.A.
 In Step 3 neighborhood signature, C_U=N.A., Aκ=N.A. (Aκ=N.A., thus κ determination reported as out of scope), resulting in Cκ=N.A. and Sθ=N.A. Therefore, the Regime is classified as R?.
(2020)
The 2020 results are as follows. In the Step1 growth channel determination, the cumulative IRF was (N.A.), and C_Y was judged as N.A.
In the Step2 alternative channel, cumulative reaction was observed at (N.A.), and C_ALT was judged as N.A.
 In Step 3's neighborhood signature, C_U=N.A., Aκ=N.A. (reported as κ determination out of scope due to Aκ=N.A.), and Cκ=N.A. and Sθ=N.A. were obtained. Therefore, the Regime is classified as R4 (exogenous shock branch).
(2025)
The results for 2025 are as follows. In the Step1 growth channel determination, the cumulative IRF was (N.A.), and C_Y=N.A. was determined.
 In the Step2 alternative channel, cumulative response was observed at (N.A.), and C_ALT=N.A. was determined. , and C_ALT=N.A. was determined.
 In Step 3's neighborhood signature, C_U=N.A., Aκ=N.A. (reported as κ determination out of scope due to Aκ=N.A.), Cκ=N.A., and Sθ=N.A. were observed. Therefore, the Regime is classified as R?.

Note: Since Aκ(t) in your definition requires “within-window variation (e.g., std)”, the table above is “input observations”, and the validity of Aκ is delegated to Process 2 (after window extraction).
A.2 Input for Pillar 3 (RAR) (Currently Delegated: Only formula and series ID fixed)
RAR is defined as RAR = CFC / GFCF per your definition. In the UK, the same definition is possible using World Bank indicators.
CFC: NY.ADJ.DKAP.CD (equivalent to consumption of fixed capital)
GFCF: NE.GDI.FTOT.CD
However, since missing values may occur by year (especially recent years), it is safer to have the estimator obtain and fill in the same series.

IV.4.7 Decision trace (Short log placed in main text: UK)
% Decision trace (UK)
2015: Step1 requires IRF estimation to determine C_Y. Step2 requires alternative-channel IRFs to determine C_ALT.
Step3 inputs are recorded (U, pi, dw). A_kappa, kappa_hat, and S_theta are evaluated only after windowing (W quarters).
2020: Classified as R4 (exogenous-shock branch) by the operational rule. Still record Step3 inputs; do not infer structural regime from 2020 alone.
2025: Use latest available readings for U, pi, and dw as inputs. Final regime classification requires Step1/Step2 IRFs and (if applicable) kappa_ref construction.

% Decision trace (China)
2015: $C_Y$ and $C{\mathrm{ALT}}$ require LP/VAR-based cumulative IRFs and are not evaluated here; observables report $U$ and CPI. $\kappa$-based proximity test is not executed without $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\kappa{\mathrm{ref}}$.
2020: Treated as an exogenous-shock year (COVID) and recommended to separate as R4* for regime inference; IRF-based conditions remain to be estimated.
2025: Latest official releases are used in place of full-year final values (urban surveyed unemployment H1 average; CPI y/y for Oct); IRF-based classification and $\kappa_{\mathrm{ref}}$ construction remain pending.
